"Hotel the pearl is perfect place to stay in Delhi Paharganj. whole staff are very helpful, informative. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel's location was very convenient, and we had a truly wonderful stay.. Most recommended.."
Location of the hotel is perfect. The hotel is peaceful and nice. The staff is very kind and nice rooms. I recommend this hotel..
"Location, Indian food."
"The location and the hotel itself is great. Next time I will stay here. Nice rooms with comfortable beds. good attitude of staff, they are helpful and explain you everything you ask them."
"Friendly and smiling staffs.. The reception staff are so excellent and ready to help me any time, location is fantastic near all the attractions, room was big and comfortable.."

"We love the hotel, again come back to the hotel soon. the staff is very welcoming and friendly. food was awesome best quality, service was exceptional, there was absolutely no issue and satisfactory results.. Stay was great.."
Nice hotel with comfortable stay.. I would highly recommend it. the service from the staff was excellent and the facilities and breakfast were also great. i would stay here again!
"- I felt safe.
- Staff has been pleasantly and quickly responsive before we came at the hotel as much as during the stay. Great sense of service and you get what's shown/told  (which to be honest has been rarely the case in india from my own experience).
- Good location - near the metro and the karol bagh market without being completely in the congested streets (but the area still gets crowded during busy hours of the day making it difficult to even walk around the area which could be a bit overwhelming).
- Rooms : clean and spacious (we took a triple bed room), quiet. There is a lift for heavy luggage and/or staff is happy to help as well to bring your stuff to the room. - there is a separation between the ""showering space"" and the toilets (hallelujah! So you don't have to walk wet feet in the bathroom - this is a detail but luxury point which is pleasant) :) 
- wifi works well
- food facility is there - food is good"
It's good stay. Staff are very cooperative.  Good cleaning. Required variety in breakfast.
"Breakfast was good, but we couldn't take it every day as we were out. Food other than bf was also excellent & tasty. The reception & staff are also very helpful and cooperative."
the staff was good and accommodating
It was very comfortable
staff service was good
The hotel staff is very good.

Good Experience
Overall good with good helping staff. Immediately response when need. Hospitality is good towards the visitors.
Zunaid was very helpful with service. He has been helpful on every trip and stay at White Klove. Front dest Azar is also very professional.
It's just need little more cleaning in room
Cleanliness and staff behaviour
"Large room, comfortable bed, great room service. Large washroom, great shower"
No fuss property. Staff was cooperative and ready to help.
"Normal room, but sheets and pillows had marks from previous guests on them. Unexceptable, they need to make sure to put in new sheets rather than use old ones that are marked. Other than that the stay was good tho, the staff were great and the food was really good"
Cleanliness and cordial relation maintained by staff
Very nice hotel and good service
really well located for sightseeing. Paharganj is also quite an experience in itself.
""
"Mr. Sanjay ad shibu and his staff will made you feel at home with all their hospitality, sympathy and always trying to help you for everything you need from the stay at the hotel until tours, trains, buses, money changer, everything!!!"
"Personals are good and help you if needed.
Not a lot of noise in our room.
AC working."
Everything there was excellent.
"Very friendly and helpful staff, good value for money"
The place was 10 minutes walking from metro station. The staff was great. Breakfast was for room service and its okay. The district seems dangerous but it was not a problem after the first day :) Kfc and Dominos is near. Best A/C that I saw in India.

"Beds are confortable, price quality is good. Clean space, food was good. Big room."
Helpful travel desk at reception!
"There is confusion regarding the location of the hotel when one searches on Google Maps. But, the actual location of the hotel is well connected to the road. So, please make sure to identify the right location before checking-in. :D"
Very helpful and friendly staff. Spacious and clean rooms. 24 hour check in so checked in at 7am!
"The hotel is close to many touristic places; the hotel team is amazing, they are really helpfull and specially Shikha, who is always with a smile in her face and ready to help you to know more about India and dishes."

Nice hotel.
The hotel staff is very helpful and courteous - they are always available to help answer. Rooms were hygienic and clean. The staff was very professional.
Hotel has for me a good value for money. Staff was friendly and competent. Room are spacious enough and every days they clean the room..
"Wonderful hotel nice location close to airport.. I thank management and staffs for their attentive, friendly and outstanding service.. All rooms are air conditioned and well equipped.. We greatly appreciate the hospitality and excellent service.."

#NAME?
Closeness to the airport
We had a fabulous staying in airport grand hotel .. it was a nice experience the room was very good the hotel provided all the necessary facilities the staff was helping and warm the food was yummy overall it was a pleasure to stay here..
The room and washroom were very clean. the linen was and clean without any spots. breakfast spread was tasty and well cooked.. The staff was extra helpful... hotel was excellent in service... i really liked the place. would love to stay again..
"Very friendly staff, good location, super clean, awesome food, everything was spot on n' upto my expectations. will visit the same hotel soon and recommend to all.."
Ankit - assistant manager was awesome. foodit shell at breakfast buffet
The music from the bar was very very very loud. I couldn't here the man that was booking me in at the arrival desk... so ridiculous... it's a hotel for usually tired travellers and to be greeted by this horrible noise felt like an assault. They eventually turned it down after many requests. Was by just me ... others waiting also hated the noise.
"Clean rooms, polite and hospitable staff"
It is a luxurious hotel in very convenient location for air travellers. The hotel room was very comfortable with all essential amenities. The buffet breakfast was sumptuous. Staff are friendly and helpful.
Nice location
"Location, swimming pool,"
"The breakfast was very elaborate and excellent!!
The only thing I liked most at the hotel was it’s breakfast menu."
"As mentioned in my previous review and the reasons I keep on returning to this property is best value for money compared to any other hotel in aero city,a cluster of hotels including international chain of hotels located 10-15 mins from New Delhi domestic and international terminal. Novotel in my opinion offers everything that other hotels do ,but at best best price as I have had stays in other hotels of aero city as well .
Also the staff is very polite,smiling and helpful.

"This booking was made on behalf of my daughter after she found herself without passport or any credit cards or debit cards and little cash. A long story. 
I made the booking from the uk and after a few emails and speaking to the extremely helpful duty manager.    
We were able to find a solution to my daughters predicament and get her checked in. 
As a parent I cannot express my gratitude to the staff at the holiday inn. 
Her stay has been comfortable. 
My mind is at peace knowing that she is safe and in good hands. 
Thank you so much"

 · I regret taking the stay over there and please do confirm all the information the hotel provides before adding it to the list of hotels to show I had to pay more and was in a situation where I couldn't even switch to another hotel for stay I really want to get refund.
 · It was a disaster. How can such a poor hotel even be listed in booking platforms

"Excellent Location, Friendly staff, Efficient Check in and Check out process, good food"
I had a simple breakfast
Nearby airport
ITS GOOD
location and friendly staff
"The room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. As we had a day between flights and  planned to stay at the hotel all day and catch up on a few things, the bar area was comfortable with power sockets for charging devices. A good choice of food for both breakfast and dinner. There is a buffet at 7 pm, but we chose from the menu. The price was reasonable for that level of hotel and was able to provide airport drop-off service. It served its purpose."
"Very nice hotel set in comfortable grounds where one can walk outdoors. Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Staff were amazing! Duty manager Urmila was exceptionally - she made us feel as though we were visiting friends rather than staying in a hotel :) She was friendly, courteous and professional - as were all the staff we interacted with. Food in the in-house restaurant was also good. Would definitely stay here again."
"Myself and my wife stayed at your excellent hotel for one night (24th-25th April).
Our stay was very pleasant, the room and bathroom were clean and smelled fresh.
We had dined at your inhouse restaurant in the evening, (al la carte) the food was exceptional both the veg and non veg.
The waiter ( name I cannot recall) was really good as he went out of his way to serve and answer questions my wife was asking him regarding the menu.
(what he could not answer he went and confirmed with the head chef). 
Next day we had an early morning flight to catch, after checking out we faced difficulties with the arranged taxi, your reception staff
(Mr Himanshu, Mr Vinod and Mr Mayur) were very helpful in assisting us with our transport and calming us with refreshment while we waited.  
Before booking the reservations at your hotel we had already made provisional booking for a hotel at AeroCity, (that being closer to the airport)
After staying at Four Points Sheraton, we WILL be highly recommending all our friends and family to stay here as your staff are your BEST asset.
Looking forward to our next visit to India."
Very hygienic and good location
Wonderful property.
Very nice property
Dirty bathroom and rooms .They didn’t even kept a  dustbin in the room
" · This is the worst hotel experience I ever had. I got booking confirmation and when I reached the place in the middle of the night with a child they said where is no room for me. They lied, trying to pretend this is not the place where I have booking, but where is definitely no any other iconic. Anyway heavy alcohol smell and dirt was there. Doesn’t match pictures. Horrible stuff"
Nothing
"Online photos did not match the actual rooms . The toilets were dirty with paan stairs all over, staff was also non cooperative."

Food was also amazing. I Will Recomend this hotel.
" · Value for Money
 
 The room was neat and tidy. It totally met my expectations for a comfortable stay after a long tour. The hotel staff was very friendly and cooperative. Especially receptionist Roshan  helped in making arrangements up to the mark. It's hardly 2km from Delhi Aerocity metro station easing connectivity to Delhi as well. I didn't opt for breakfast in package but their masala omelette was good. The overall stay was pleasant and relaxing. A perfect hotel near IGI airport."
"The kitchen was able to accommodate my needs - I have many intolerances and they made a safe meal for me when I asked. 
The staff was able to move us into a better room and find ways to fix what was broken (not everything, but they were trying)."
very good i really enjoyed my stay here thanku mahesh we definitely come here again
"The reception faces the main road and is as shown on your booking.com page. After checking in, I was taken thru a back door, into a passage, with a lot of mysterious twists and turns, finally entering another building !!
I was asked to make the payment there at that counter. This counter was of another hotel (Classic, I think) and that opened into the alley behind Hotel International Inn. 
So to that extent I felt cheated. 
The interiors were shoddy. The room was spacious, but with old furniture, TV...slow Wi-Fi. The only thing is favour was the room was clean.
And the food was frightfully expensive!! absolutely 3-4 star rates."
They were not initially complying to the terms  of booking.
"Very neat clean and spacious hotel..... The hotel is at main road, at a location visible from all around. Nice entrance, rooms were very good. The manager and the staff was helpful. Nice Cozy place, in house restaurant Good Food."

The location and food were very good. The hotel was clean.
"The Location is Excellent: Very near to the airport. Taxis are easily available (I tried at 3.45AM).
I requested front desk for a quiet room and I was provided room on ground floor, which was clean and quiet at night. The AC was working well and hot water was available too. The washroom was clean too. 
Had a good sleep, as had to catch an early morning flight. 
Recommend this property to the travelers seeking a short stay for flights.
The only negative is that the Airtel signals were very poor in the room and had to go out for a call. But, maybe the other networks work well."

Breakfast was phenomenal"
"I liked the courtesy extended by the staff, one and all, good spread at the breakfast, we dined at the italian restuarant - was a good experience, at first the room was assigned was at the extreme corner of the hotel wit a city view, didn't like it, got it changed to a pool view, though again at the extreme end of the building, still did have a better with the pool view.
Overall was a pleasant experience during our 4 days stay"

"Excellent Breakfast...Especially we can order dosas :) My family is really happy.
Also very good customer service that or room got decorated because its one of my family member Birthday and it was a surprise for us."
Friendly staff. Clean hotel. Good breakfast.
Almost all facilities
" · In the morning when we arrived for breakfast, we were told that the restaurant, Nuke was fully occupied and we were taken to another restaurant. However, on my way to the other restaurant, we saw many spaces unoccupied and hence we were unable to understand the reason for the same. Is it because we were given a discounted rate by the reception staff for breakfast so a different breakfast type was assigned to us, while other guests enjoyed services at Nuke ? That seemed unfair as Nuke offered a large breakfast variety, whereas the other restaurant did not have too many breakfast options."
The staff was very nice and helpful
 · The road nearby the hotel is too dirty.
I like the hotel service staff for foods only.
Nice hotel
" · Very dirty rooms, they give wrong address and location on booking.com
When we reach on location and call them 
They give us a different location in narrow streets 
Guys don’t be a fool to book a room in this hotel !!"
Very Nice Stay
This is group of cheaters who are posting different post by the name of several properties once you book and reach on booked hotel they inform that please come to totally different hotel  ( excuse google address is not correct )  you will force to stay in very unhygienic and  uncomfortable place or you are free to cancel and go wherever you want to go ( again  you are in a very difficult location in Delhi so you have to compromise)

Location was great….next to all amenities
The support staff was good . They were reachable at any moment
Good infrastructure and rooms.
" · Highly over priced for these congested rooms. Staff's are friendly but not that professional for a hospitality business. Biggest disadvantage is that they will ask for cash alone for room payments and not card or upi. Over all its not worthy for this price, space and amenities provided."
I like your hotel and staff
The beds were comfy and modern

We were two women in a new city and we were pretty scared naturally but he was so sweet to us. he gave us directions, he told us where we could find metro stations and how we were supposed to travel from one place to another. He even arranged autos for us since we were new in the city.

Location was great….next to all amenities
The support staff was good . They were reachable at any moment
Good infrastructure and rooms.
" · Highly over priced for these congested rooms. Staff's are friendly but not that professional for a hospitality business. Biggest disadvantage is that they will ask for cash alone for room payments and not card or upi. Over all its not worthy for this price, space and amenities provided."

"staff most courteous, excellent food, excellent clean, very relaxing rooms and wonderful ambiance ,I have travelled manyplaces but nothing like this"
"Breakfast/room/cleanliness - nice place to relax after facing the heat. Given that India is not a country you can walk around easily after a day tour, this hotel is recommended to spend a rest of the day!"
great location valu for money
"All of the staff was excellent, especially thanks to Kabir and Anu for really making sure that all was smooth, pleasant, and social. All of the tours was worth it, and the social engagement was stunning.
The accomodation itself was not top notch, and the place is only as clean as you could expect from a hostel in this price range.
But all of that was just as good as it had to be, and the rest was just excellent!"
The vibe and also the simple but amazing energy in the hotel
#NAME?
"The staff made this hostel just a very nice experience. Good vibes, nice people staying here. Very helpful staff that organizes tours in Old Delhi and New Delhi. I RECOMMEND THIS STAY! :-)"
 · Rainy season is very difficult to walk around and take transportation
"Great staff who were welcoming and helpful, also ran tours and food evenings which were a great way to meet people."
"We stayed in a double private room. The room is spacious for 2 people, the en-suite bathroom is modern, with hot and cold water, all toiletries (including toilet paper upon request) were provided and the AC unit was powerful and silent. 
The location is not exactly in the main tourist area BUT they are 5 min walk to the metro and from there you can go anywhere in the city. We didn’t join but they also provide tours to the main attractions of old Delhi for a good price."
The socializing atmosphere
"The hostel is only a couple minutes walking from the metro which is good because I stayed here only one night just to fly out of Delhi (I stayed in a different hostel when I previously spent a few days in Delhi and wish I had chosen Joey’s then). To get to the airport you have to change trains twice but it is very easy and so cheap! The hostel seemed very social and appeared to have events on every night. Beds comfy with curtains, and the girls bathroom on the first floor had 3 toilets and 3 showers, so plenty of space. Staff were very friendly, too. I would definitely stay again."
Group tours are really good
"I enjoyed my stay at Avatar Living.  The room was great and was pretty quiet at night.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The poha and pancake breakfast combo was simple, healthy and tasty.  I also appreciated the fast responses to my messages on booking.com."
"Great location, bed was very comfortable & shower was great"
Helpful staff. Good location. Room was clean
"The location is just perfect, if you don’t want to get hassled by busy Delhi. Very clean and tidy place, with all the comforts and amazing breakfast! Very sweet and helpful people! Thank you very much!"
The staff and owner are helpful. It is spotlessly clean. Comfortable and affordable for its location. The caretaker/manager of the B&B stays in the property and is available to cook home made meals.
"I love the free Dhal fry. 
I love the owner. Very hospitable. 
I love the staffs, they cook really well. It’s not too spicy, not too much spices, not too much garlic and onions. I will surely go back for the delicious Dhal fry. 
Also advice for travelers who are always hot, there is a room that has a huge AC, you can request for it."
Close to the Embassy's; I was staying while waiting for VISA purposes. Friendly and helpful staff; really go out of their way to help you out in case you are new to the area or need anything. There's home-cooked food available also.
Very helpful and accommodating staff. Would recommend anyone to stay here.

"1. Front desk phone receiver don’t picks phone, could get only after several calls.

3. Front desk services to be more Tata type of effectiveness, I never saw it.
I mentioned to hotel staff that we want to help Tata staying in their hotels or using any
of their business in India, but just because of some employees different interests, egos and unprofessional attitudes,Tata’s name and fame should not be downgraded. 
I think, if employees are reorganised with quality personality and trainings, Vivanta Dwaraka New Delhi would do much better name and fame."

The staff were super friendly and helpful. The kitchen had everything you could need - stove, micro, toaster, fridge, plates, cutlery and was clean and tidy. The common room was comfy with some books/guitar, but as everyone else says, the rooftop was the highlight with the plants, comfy seats, fans & plants  - loved sitting there to read or eat one of our many Zomato orders. The hostel is located in a typical Indian neighborhood which I found fab, loved seeing the hustle & bustle. It's pretty close to the airport which is handy, and quite a few attractions."

The location is near to the New Delhi Railway Station. To be specific In a narrow ally from Main Bazaar Road Named Chandi Wali Gali. To easily find the hotel find the Citi Bank ATM booth and enter the ally beside it. Take the first right from there you will get it. The rooms and toilets are clean and properly maintained. Cleaned every morning. Staffs are jolly and really helpful. You can leave and come back at midnight and they won’t mind. There is a pet pug who will company you and escort you till your room (of course if you like dogs). Overall real value for money.

"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Godwin Deluxe, conveniently located near New Delhi Railway Station in the bustling area of Paharganj. Our choice was influenced by its reputation as a clean and tidy hotel, a perfect pit stop as we needed to catch an early train to Jaipur the next morning.
The hotel's facilities exceeded our expectations. Our room boasted a stunning view of the cityscape, which was especially captivating during sunset and at night. The room service was prompt and efficient, attending to our requests with a courteous and friendly demeanor.
A highlight for us was the complimentary high-speed WiFi, allowing us to stay connected effortlessly. This amenity is often overlooked in many hotels, but Hotel Godwin Deluxe ensured seamless internet access. The breakfast spread was a delightful array of both local and continental choices, giving us the energy we needed to kick-start our day.
The hotel's location was truly a blessing. Its proximity to the railway station eased our travel plans, saving us from the chaos of Delhi's traffic. Despite being close to the station, the hotel's ambiance remained serene and insulated from the outside noise.
Hotel Godwin Deluxe provided us with a wonderful and convenient stay. From the cleanliness and efficiency to the stunning views and complimentary amenities like high-speed WiFi and breakfast, the experience was everything we could have hoped for. We left the hotel well-rested and ready for our onward journey to Jaipur, thanks to the comfort and convenience offered by this establishment."

The location is near to the New Delhi Railway Station. To be specific In a narrow ally from Main Bazaar Road Named Chandi Wali Gali. To easily find the hotel find the Citi Bank ATM booth and enter the ally beside it. Take the first right from there you will get it. The rooms and toilets are clean and properly maintained. Cleaned every morning. Staffs are jolly and really helpful. You can leave and come back at midnight and they won’t mind. There is a pet pug who will company you and escort you till your room (of course if you like dogs). Overall real value for money.

"The location was great ( in South Delhi close to metro, shopping malls, restaurants etc) overlooking nice parks with squirrels running around. The perfect way to enjoy a bit of relaxation away from the traffic and mayhem of busy Delhi.
Alfred & the rest of the staff were great, always happy to help and really knowledgeable about things to do and how to get around Delhi, and how to travel onwards from there. If things do go wrong they are efficient and professional and do their upmost to fix them promptly.
Overall we are very happy with our stay, it was good value for money. if you want more info, it will be coming soon to our YouTube channel:
Always Keep Moving 
You can see more there."
"Greater Kailash is a nice and safe suburb to live in. I felt very comfortable at Bed and Chai. The rooms and common areas are well furnished and decorated. The staff was very friendly. The food was prepared with love and fresh. However, the taste was not outstanding. 
If you are in Delhi (for a couple of days) and are looking for a relaxed place to stay, come here!"
Good location breakfast is good
"Staff members are very co-operative, friendly and helpful. Rooms are as described while booking. Overall I enjoyed the stay.easy to catch a flight early in the morning"

" · Super nice stay
  · Perfect stay near the airport, staff super friendly and helpful, always at disposition at all time for everything. Very nice quality/price. Unfortunately very short stay for us (few hours), cause the structure is really comfortable for a flight stop"
The stay at citizen was good and we did not face any problems. Toilet and room were cleaned and quite spacious as well. Wi-Fi had good speed. The ac was a life saver in scorching Delhi heat. I recommend staying here.
The location is excellent if one need to stay close to the airport. The hotel is affordable and quiet. Good airport drop and pick up facility available.Hotel staff are friendly and helpful.
" · Totally recommend this budget friendly place.
 
 Nice room. Very friendly and helpful staff. Very close to the airport. Great food at dinner and breakfast."
"Very good hotel in a great location. There are many food joints nearby as well as various stores, in a walking distance. The staff was very accommodating and helpful.

"Nothing to like , hotel is pathetic."
The room I stayed in was nothing short of magnificent.

Staff and the room
"Value for money. Obviously there are other great hotels in fancy neighbourhoods of New Delhi which are better but if you do not want to spend much or you want a hotel in this particular locality then you should definitely consider this place. Great staff, good rooms, clean washroom, and awesome food.
I checked in at 3 in the morning was hungry and was happy to know the kitchen was open and I ordered a delicious chicken curry and then had a hot shower and was completely out of my jetlag, definitely one of the best hotels in this price range. Even booked a taxi from them for local sight seeing. The morning buffet was great, continental as well as Indian breakfast available and the place was relatively quiet considering it is near a railway station."
"It's like a fish market,  the staff cheat guest very badly,  fraud . It's a place where you can do illegal activities by booking a room.   HONESTLY DO NOT VISIT OR STAY IN THIS PLACE.  WORST IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD. MY PACKAGE INCLUDES BREAKFAST.  WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING AND HOT WATER WAS NOT COMING.  WHEN I DIALED 9. HE SAID HE WILL GIVE WATER IN BUCKET. BREAKFAST WAS JUST A PIECE OF PAROTTA WITH A SACHET OF TAMOTTO SAUCE.  BAD BAD 👎.  WHEN I CHECKED IN THE BOY SAID EVERYTHING IS AVAILABLE.  HE STARTED SHOWING GIRLS PICTURES WITH RATES. SICK PLACE"

"With all the fake reviews out there, it was a relief to find somewhere safe, clean and in a good location - even if it was a little more expensive than the budget options. Close to metro and train station / tuk tuk to any of the major sites 50-130 affordably. Free water (bottled dispenser), helpful front desk to find a hairdresser, helped book trains and a pre-paid car back to the airport, lift for luggage, staff members helping take up luggage and load up the car. Room had a safe you can enter the combination into each time you wish to use it."

"Definitely one of the cleanest hostels I've stayed at in Delhi. All common areas and kitchen kept really clean, no late night parties or loud music to contend with. Really well located in safe and quiet part of South Delhi.
Lots of fruit vendors and five minute walk to supermarket and food outlets, less than 10 minute walk to Kailash Colony Metro station"

Most cosy beds and great hospitality by Abhishek bhai and delicious food by Mukesh bhai
Pretty good. Kind and accommodating staff. Pretty clean place.
"I recently had a remarkable stay at a Sleepy Fox. The staff members were incredibly friendly and helpful, ensuring a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The hostel was clean and comfortable, with well-maintained dormitories and inviting common areas. The communal atmosphere made it easy to meet fellow travelers and engage in memorable experiences. The location was convenient, and the rates were affordable, offering excellent value for money. I highly recommend this hostel for a fantastic stay in Delhi."
"The location is good and I love their meals exactly like home-cooked meals.  The staff is very supportive and friendly as well because of which I felt at home. It's a good property to stay and their facilities are value for money and they are very good with their schedule for everything including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even cleaning. It's a great place to stay for solo travelers who love to stay away from the crowded suburbs of NCR."

"Please don't choose this place. 
They collaborate with treebo to fool the customers. They will probably try to delete this review and fool more people. 
They are cheats. They refuse to acknowledge your booking at lower price or say something wrong with your booking and try and squeeze more money from you when you checkin... 
It's also unclean. Treebo is part of this cheating... please stay away."

Basic hotel close to the airport.
"This is a review for Hotel Arch, not Anand Lok Inn. When I reached Anand Lok Inn, they said they were placing me in Hotel Arch, which is located about 200 meters away and is probably the same management.
I stayed for a day, then had to leave Delhi and return the next day. When I came back to Delhi I chose to stay at Hotel Arch again.
At Hotel Arch there were mostly pluses, hardly any minuses.
They didn't have a kettle in the room, which is a minus, but one was provided on request, and the staff even offered to put coffee/ tea sachets. I had my own coffee, so I declined, but the offer was there. 
Hot water was nice and hot, worked well. 
The buffet dinner was tasty. 
They have 24 hour room service, which is excellent.
The staff was very polite.
The location is convenient: close to the airport. It's not pretty, but the market is a minute's walk away, which is usually good news.
The room costs very little, so overall the hotel is great value for money."
Good spacious toom
at least the staff were good and helpful.
Hotel Anand Lok inn is really cosy next to the airport. The Hotel location is very good. The rooms are of good size.The service largely is good. The property has good facilities for being in the city centres.

"Location, staff behaviour, comfort."
"No breakfast , no wifi and the location was pathetic . It was above the liquor store...basically unsafe. Moreover the booking was on the name of Apple tree but the actual name was Mahraja. 
The person present over there told that ,they take the bookings on the name of Apple Tree but actual name is Mahraja. These people are mocking the costomers by showing the different property and providing the room at different place."

Very happy with my stay at pamposh guest house :) lovely staff and excellent central location within GK2 market block. Nice park opposite the hotel and good variety of restaurants and shops nearby. Lots of banks and ATMs around also for foreigners needing to withdraw money. Would have booked another few nights there if I hadn’t already booked elsewhere. Indian breakfast was delicious also!

This hotel offers a very good value for a low price."

"I recently stayed at Fab Hotel Jasmine with my family while my father was undergoing treatment at the nearby Apollo Hospital. I must say that our experience at this hotel was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived, the staff at Fab Hotel Jasmine displayed a level of consideration and genuine care that was truly heartwarming. They went above and beyond to ensure that we felt comfortable, safe, and well taken care of during our stay. Given the stressful circumstances surrounding our visit, their attentiveness made a significant difference and put us at ease.
One aspect that particularly impressed us was the cleanliness of the hotel. The housekeeping staff provided prompt and efficient service each day. It was evident that the hotel maintained high standards of hygiene. 
The buffet breakfast offered at Fab Hotel Jasmine was simply excellent. Furthermore, the hotel's kitchen service was available round the clock, which was incredibly convenient for us, as we often had unpredictable schedules due to hospital visits.
I must also mention the exceptional service provided by the manager, Uday, and his team. Uday's kindness and attentiveness were truly commendable, and his staff followed suit. They consistently went the extra mile to ensure our needs were met and that we were comfortable throughout our stay. Initially, we had booked the hotel for just two days, assuming that we would eventually move to a more affordable option. However, as our stay progressed, we realized that the level of kindness displayed by the hotel staff and the quality of services provided were worth every penny. We decided to extend our stay at Fab Hotel Jasmine without any hesitation.
Our experience at this hotel was truly memorable, and we are grateful for the care we received during our stay."

I was staying with my family for 13 days. All staff were humble and listen the service raised by me or my family members. Food was delicious and prepared as per my requirement as I am allergic to some food ingredients. Room cleaning and hygiene were awesome.

It was really nice place to stay as a solo traveller. I was in a room near a rooftop and my night strolls helped me to sleep better. There was a nice living area in each floor where I spent time when I didn't want to be in my room. I was quite late to come almost everyday and they were nice about it. The neighbourhood is very interesting and vibrant. I never felt scared walking alone at night here.
Location and service
Room spacious and fit to short term stay. Entertainment option needs improvement as according to room type. Complementary indian desi type tea or coffee if introduced in case of king room great
It’s very neat n clean and homely atmosphere
Formal type bed and breakfast property with lots of space to wander around and room clean and spacious especially in king room. Lift at back side of the property which demand someone to walk few extra minutes toward reception area if needed. Historical tomb just opposite to property.
"very nice staff, they helped with everything, good location, close to shops and restaurants, clean - according to European standards."
"Very courteous staff. Quick response. Very delicious home like food at very reasonable price. 
The accommodation we were provided was like an office suite with two large bedrooms and bathrooms. This was a pleasant surprise."
"room is decent size, bed is comfortable."
"The room was very comfortable, location is super convenient (many tuk-tuks available just in front of the hotel, a lot of cafes around, near to the metro station and very close to a huge mall).

Bell boy, guy which was friendly and smile (i leave cash for him at check-out) did help me with luggage, at morning coffe with milk want to room or come down and sit at kitchen. Every question and quiery was total fix. My flight was delayed, but driver had waited me at pay airport parking  with info my name and surname.  It was expensive for me, but owner promised to invite me, and he done it. Thank you otherwise I stay alone at night Delhi."
"The safety was pretty good, they locked all the main gates of the hotel after 11pm so that's good."
Staff were very helpful.  Went out of the way to accommodate our travel plan to prepare food for us.  Very cordial too.

It wasn't worth at all . Rooms are no closer to images on booking.com. feel cheated.

Hotel located in mahipalpur area just 10 minutes drive from the airport. Hotel was good.
"Location was close to airport. Room is big and clean, staffs responded and actioned immediately for any calls to the reception."
"We arrived late because our flight to Delhi was cancelled, so we only stayed in the hotel for a couple of hours. The staff at the reception was courteous and took good care of us. It was very convenient to stop in this hotel even for a short time. The staff helped us find a taxi in the morning. The room was more than adequate and very affordable. I would choose the same hotel if I had to go back to Delhi."

"The beds were really comfy and the rooms were clean and the bathrooms well appointed. The staff changed our room when we asked for a window room, and were very accomodating. There are all the facilities you need right in the hotel foyer like money change at a good rate, booking cars and tours around Delhi etc. All the prices were fair also. The location is only a 5 minute tuk tuk ride from Connaught Circus and central to all the main parts of Delhi."

Stay was good. But they allow only room service and they charge 15% service charge over and above the GST. So food ordering is not good here. The cost is quite high. Rest all is well. Staff was nice and no problem in stay.
 · Materess
 · Rooms were not properly clean. Toilet seat was broken and duct taped. Owner charged more money than original.
"From the moment I arrived, I felt like a valued guest. Outstanding hospitality!"
Great service and breakfast. Me and my wife also hired a day tour with private driver and it was great. We visited all main attractions in the city.
Friendly staff. Great value for money.
"Very central location, good sized room, very helpful staff, good breakfast. Amazing value for money."
"Relatively clean, AC, but you get what you pay for."
An excellent stay in Paharganj area. Hotel facilities are excellent.Location is perfect. Staff behaviour is good. Would like to visit again.
"Room was good,staff was good"
Spacious rooms
The staff were friendly and was run well. Location very handy to get to the airport and around town.
A good basic hotel. Room was fine and clean
"Staff was amazing! Very helpful and providing us everything we needed, even from the street not to walk us two (girls) alone late in Delhi"
"Staff is very good
Clean room"
Value for money. Well-mannered staff. Decent rooms.
Nothing
"Super nice staff, comfortable stay, clean toilets, food was available till as late as 1 in the morning"
Food was good and staff was very helpful
"Staff is really kind and helpfull, rooms are confortable with every services. Raccomanded"
The interior was nice but not well maintained
" · MOST IMPORTANTLY...THE RECEPTIONIST DID NOT GIVE US THE KEY OF THE ROOM.  WE HAD TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITHOUT THE KEY. HE LOCKED AND OPENED THE ROOM FOR US.
The water supply was off in the morning because of which I got late for my interview.  He even refused to change our room.
I had to call the receptionist for basic things. 
It was an extremely poor experience. Even a third class hotel would be better than this. Bathrooms were not clean. There were no glasses provided.
I had to ask for clean cups and other basic items.
For this price I could get a way better hotel.
I WANT A REFUND. I DONT WANT TO PAY SUCH AMOUNT FOR SUCH A CHEAP HOTEL."
"The hotel is luxurious and well maintained. i really enjoyed our stay and everything from the service, the rooms the restaurant food and polite, attentive staff was outstanding."
"Humble, cooperative management's and helpful staffs."
Suite and Family Rooms are large and comfortable. Breakfast is fresh and quite good as is the food in general.
Nearest to Railway Station
"Overall performance is awesome , best wishes to all the staffs for their wonderful service , congratulations for the good service , would like to visit again to this hotel"
"we didn’t get the picture of the newer rooms like some in the add. 
Room was clean and quite big, with a couch, fridge, 2 chairs and a table. The metro and railway station is 15 minutes walk with a few Restaurants close by. Ac was good."
 · Air condition was not working properly
" · A very bad experience in New Delhi, taxi driver sent by the hotel and threatening to not bring me to the hotel if I don't give him tips, asking again for tips in the room, scary situation, feel unsafe, very dirty and broken, have changed hotel the next day
Avoid this hotel"
Staff and particularly the reception staff was polite and good. My late check in was done comfortable by night staff.Forth visit to hotel really comfortable stay bathroom was neat and clean staff cooperative
Location is Good at Paharganj. Apart from that nothing is Good.
Hotel is located very close to train station.. Its very nice experience with this hotel and got full co-operation with staffs. rooms are spacious and nice.. All staffs are full cooperative n supportive they have quick response. Thanks for your Hospitality.
"Its convenient location near the train station.. Our room was lovely, spacious and very clean with lots of good light.. Highly satisfying and comfortable accommodation with friendly staff and reception. Food is also very good. Strongly recommend for family stay.."

Everything from staff to hotel
"Staffs are very friendly.
They help me to lot of things like buy new sim and help to change money from outside."
The service was exceptional as well. Would definitely send a friend there.
"The best hotel I’ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in."
The hotel was wonderful. It was even better than expected. The price was amazing. There were great restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely stay there again.
Nothing i like in this hotel
Nice place to slosh down for the night. The room and bathroom was clean and functional. The availability of the LIFT/Elevator was appreciated.  There is somebody there 24 hours. For the area it is the only decent place. For now the locality is quiet and the lack of noise was appreciated.

"Staff members are very co-operative, friendly and helpful. Rooms are as described while booking. Overall I enjoyed the stay."
Very helpful staff
Great stay at this hotel. Extremely helpful staff and excellent customer service. Great amenities including a very nice
perfect stay to experience royalty
The staff was very helpful The property is located close to the airport
" I was blown away by the creativity and innovation at this hotel. The unique design elements, from the art installations to the futuristic technology, created an atmosphere that was both inspiring and captivating"
"The stay was very comfortable. Staff members are very nice, polite, responsive and helpful. Rooms are clean and spacious. For me bathroom is very important during business stay. Here bathrooms are modern, clean, newly renovated. Another best part is Food. Food is faboulous and excellent. Fresh and delicious food directly from kitche. It saved lot of time. Very higenenic and clean hotel. Definitely recommend Hotel ambience suites for others."
"The food itself was delicious: for me the idli with vegetables was the standout, never had it before but can't wait to have it again. The dosa was very tasty, the juice and chai were both great, there was a decent choice and you can eat/drink as much as you like"
"النظافة ممتازة 
الحراسة شديدة 
الافطار متنوع 
الغرف مريحة 
قريب من السوق مشي 10 دقائق"
"Beds are comfy, the junior staff is helpful."
Close to my work
Breakfast was outstanding. Toilet flooded on the 1st night. Location great.
"We stayed here for 4 nights as tourists. The location is excellent, in walking distance to a Metro station and there is a great availability of Ubers and Olas in the surrounding area to take us around the city. The breakfast (included in our booking) was very good."
Location was perfect for our work during the day.
Fast check-in & check out experience. Every Employee was Polite and nice in interaction.
The breakfast spread
Staff were very welcoming. Especially Ashok from house keeping was very kind and professional
"Great location, tight security, lots of restaurants, pool and gym. Didn’t try the spa. Overall nice hotel great location, nightclub downstairs. Stunning lobby"

"""Clean and well maintained room, good service, hotel staff are very friendly."""
"Hotel is very nice, new built, located in kapashera near IGI Airport. Staff was very helpful and cooperative. Recommended"
interiors and location. and specifically staff and breakfast very testy
"location, rate, breakfast"
The location
 · On sites they have different pics of traces but in actually they don't even have the full traces. I booked king size room but they give twins  beds however they set room as per my order but it took 4 hours we check in 1 PM and I got room 4 pm.
Great hospitality with great staff
The rooms were great. The location was good.
"Helpful Staff.
Good breakfast."
hotel reception executives person best of the Hotel in Delhi
The place is very neat and clean. The service provided by the staff is good
Overall experience was outstanding
Nothing. Everything was worst.
" · Shower of the bathroom was not working and when complained about it at reception they were least bothered. Moreover, the air condition of the room was set at 16 which was not cooling and the sensor of it was not working. They didn't even had remote to control the temperature or switch off the AC."
Very difficult to locate the hotel if you are riding in an auto. Surroundings outside the hotel is not clean and stinking. The hotel did not inform us that milk is chargeable. We were required to pay for the milk inspite of breakfast being complimentary.
"The hotel is in a narrow gali where uber and ola doesn't reach, horrible humid wet stinky rooms but they made me to stay in vista hotel just next to it which had a bit better rooms but they charged me more for the room than what i took in booking. Scam is the broad road shown in front if the hotel and room pics are old."
 · The room pictures are not matching up in reality. The rooms were not clean at all. AC were not working.
Good staff and their services
"Politeness, cleanliness, locality, mind-blowing"
Nice its good

Everything! Staff was amazing! Every single person we encountered was just so friendly and kind and very helpful! Loved that it was located away from the hustle and bustle!
The location was fantastic and even though it is based on a main road the hotel is set back and very quiet.  Within walking distance to the subway.  Rooms beautiful with everything you could possibly need.  Breakfast too was sensational - so many choices and everything a delight.  Evening meal in the restaurant excellent quality and taste.  Swimming pool a dream to return to after a day out sightseeing.  There is nothing not to like here.
"Everything was great - nice helpful staff, very large clean room, good facilities. Breakfast was pretty decent, the restaurant menu and quality of cooking were quite good. Overall, I can recommend the hotel."
"Clean, tidy inside and out, staff were excellent and could not do enough for the customer, will return."
"Amazing hotel colonial style full of glamour in Delhi .
Great breakfast and great staff specially housekeeper John pakhumate and amazing hotel lobby staff"
Everything went well. From check-in to checkout. It was a comfortable experience. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. The staff at the Maidens Hotel are some of the friendliest and most attentive I have ever encountered. They are always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you have a comfortable stay. The food was deliciously prepared.
"Charming old colonial hotel with beautiful rooms, delicious breakfast and the most amazing staff that would go over and beyond with whatever help or assistance was needed."
I have previously stayed at the Maidens on three other occasions.  This visit did not dissapoint. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay the best experience. From the minute you walk through the door till you depart you are treated like family .
"Amazing rooms and fantastic service. All staff couldnt do enough for you. They went above and beyond decorating my mums room with petals and balloons for a birthday suprise and even provided birthday cake whilst we were at dinner. The pool is beautiful and very relaxing, especially with a beautiful peacock roaming around. Would 100% reccomend and definitely come back again."
"The staff were fantastic. The food just lovely. 
A special mention to Kuldeep in the bar who mixes beautiful cocktails and has a very nice manner indeed. His language and mixing  skills are just perfect."
"As a female traveller duo, we felt very safe and comfortable in our stay"
The location is perfect and room neet and clean
"You can make arrangement for sitting in lobby for the guests. Other than that, everything is good."
Good and wish dinner could also be arranged
Staff were very professional and room was clean.
"Location is good and convenient. Room has basic amenities in good condition. A/c, TV, small fridge, a safe, electric kettle - all in place and working well"
 · Tv not working at all
"The location is really good in a good locality. On the main road, easy to find cabs. The staff is also super nice and the rooms neat and clean. Would recommend. They even have AC backup for the power cuts."
Location is just excellent. A ceiling fan in toilet is an advantage to the hot Delhi climate. Wifi speed is around 25 mbps which was good.
"I stayed for 4 nights and it was pretty nice and clean , location is great and staffs were nice"
Its was great Experience .. Awesome location
"Hotel is neat and clean. 
Amenities in room is good. 
Staff is well supportive."
Room size is good
"Location, staff behaviour"
"Worst experience, room was stinking no room freshner Or any other facilities I booked for ac room but they give us non ac room! They charged full money on the check in time! Bed was not comfortable at all and the sheet was very dirty! Not recommend for stay"
Nothing .
it had a bed
" · Nothing 
Whenever at night , I reached the hotel with my family member they said no rooms are vacant . Although i booked 3 rooms in advance 
Also on the same day i called to hotel management 3 times and inform that we will come at 9:00 PM and he said that don't worry come freely . But when i called him lastly that i reached to your hotel location he asked me my personal contact no . I gave him my contact and he called me on my contact no and said that rooms are not free. So this is very disappointing. I went there with my family including children + old age citizen and we faced very difficulties in searching the other hotel. Don't select this hotel as your choice"
Gud for one night stand.

Though the lift didnt work, they carried my bags up 
they were apologetic over the electricity short circuit but got it fixed the next morning and changed my room."

This is tarnishing your reputation.  Take care immediately"
"this place is very clean and the staff is very nice and helpful!! Small but comfortable common areas. The bathrooms were modern and clean, The rooms are not very big, but they are comfortable and clean."
"I absolutely loved my dormitory room! The cozy space provided a perfect atmosphere for relaxation. The room was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities, including a comfortable bed and ample storage"
Best service one can find for the price! The establishment features a welcoming common area with a kitchen and a cook available from 09:00 am till 11:00 pm.
Nice a spacious rooms. The breakfast offers a good selection of local goods and western. The service at the breakfast is also great

when i told them they said i have to pay the same price which i paid on the first night and they charged me the full price for the second day"
it's good location and Very good and luxurious room. Very good for a family stay. More cooperative and nice staff

The JPM hotel looks really attractive and the prices are competitive. The rooms are spacious and clean.

"We booked this place for the day, in order to keep the luggage available between a night train and a flight at night and take a shower. This is not too far from the metro yellow line that goes to the airport : just need to walk 10-15 min though the New Delhi station.
When we arrived early in the morning, no room was yet available so we were sent to another hotel nearby for a slightly higher fee.
Correct and basic hotel in the middle of narrow streets with not much comfort."
El hotel estaba cerrado cuando llegamos. Llamé por teléfono y me dijeron que no estaba abierto hasta el 13 de septiembre. Tendrían que quitar el hotel hasta esa fecha. Me parece que es una estafa

"staff

"The staff was quite helpful and fortunately the AC worked wonders. The location itself is pretty central - but do not assume it is a nice, touristy area! The room offered what I needed and the bed was pretty clean."
Everything was good except the wet floor. Floor was wet all the time.
" · Room servis not good, did not make up bed and clean room regularly"
"Rooms are clean, Bathroom is very clean. Reception staff is very good. Only problem is that it doesn't have fooding facility but still can consider this Hotel. I really liked it. It's very nice and comfortable. I would give it 4 Star out of 5."
All the staffs are quite ok. Front desk staff was cooperative.
"There was no breakfast, location is in the market which was closeby to metro, railway. 
Aro water was available."
"Close proximity to train station as well as tourist sites, with an abundance of markets near for all shopping needs"
Room was OK.  Served. It's purpose as only had to stay overbite. Price reasonable
Excellent hotel very comfortable close to a lot of things and great food nearby
I didn't opt out for breakfast but the location is good.
"Room, location, bathroom size, AC, bed quality & cushioning"
Ok
 · The area there has no hoardings of fab hotel hence looks quite unsatisfactory
"Being a hotelier by profession, I know the hotel operations in detail. I am glad that I chose this property. The facilities were great and service was great too."
I have been regular to this property and excellent property. Very well trained and friendly staff. Sparkling clean hotel. Excellent food and room service is quick. Room size is big with big toilet and shower area.
"staff most courteous, excellent food, excellent clean, very relaxing rooms and wonderful ambiance ,I have travelled manyplaces but nothing like this"
"Breakfast/room/cleanliness - nice place to relax after facing the heat. Given that India is not a country you can walk around easily after a day tour, this hotel is recommended to spend a rest of the day!"
great location valu for money
It is a beautiful property in a well established residential area. Very well maintained and quiet. This is home away from home. I thank Mr. Abdul and his team for making my stay very comfortable.
everything was very nice.  right from the check in process to the room it was very good. the bathroom however could have been of a more decent size. there was very less water coming through the taps. location was mind blowing
really spacious room. had lots of areas to roam. near posh area of gk1 and mblock market. staff was extremely helpful and friendly. highly recommended.
"Staff , especially Abdul and his team and food was homely ."
"Right from the onset, My wife and I fell in love with the place. Afzal, hope I got the name right was a gem. He welcomed us with a heart warming smile. After finishing the formalities of the check-in we were shown our room and we were blown away. We have been to quite a few B&Bs but this was different. The place was tastefully done up with a lovely lounge area on the ground floor and the first floor with a balcony full of lovely plants. Not to forget the superb collection of books.
After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.
We extended our stay by a few hours and when I was not able to get a taxi to go to the airport, Afzal arranged it in a jiffy.
Thank you Team The Neem for this little hidden gem."
"Excellent location in a quiet and gated neighbourhood, shops and restaurants a couple of minutes walk away.
The staff is really excellent! Kind and very helpful.
The room is spacious and decently equipped.
Highly recommended!"
"Clean rooms ,Location and The service is amazing.
Special thanks to the boys Ajay and Afzal who wer available 24/7 to help."
"very clean, exactly as pictured. No complaints whatsoever regarding comfort of room. free drinking water, mini fridge in room, the room was really sizeable. great for two people."
Everything about this place is near on faultless. Abdul the manager is available and willing to provide a 5* service around the clock. The place and room is super clean and fresh and the building holds a positive energy in itself. If you choose to have dinner you will not be disappointed. Fresh and delicious dishes were provided. I felt safe and like I was home away from home. Will definitely be returning when I visit Delhi again.
"Home away from home. Great location in a quietish sububarb but accessible to travel to places of interest. Great customer service from start to end. Regular communication once booking was made; on arrival staff were warm, friendly, accessible and helpful. Establishment felt safe and was clean, comfortable with a relaxing environment. A common room was a great alternative if you did not want to be restricted to your room."
Hotel was superb. Room was very spacious and beautiful 🤩 Reception guys was really great . and main thing food of this hotel in restaurant were so amazing 🤩 best Indian food you can get ever over there. Room was more then expectation. Will be great in this price if you add breakfast and pool facilities.
"the location suited us well. main reason for booking. 
cost was reasonable too"
Entrance lobby was amazing. Bedding was clean.
"The hotel is ok but the bar is not in working mode, which they should have informed in advance."
"Good breakfast and dinner, good room , great staff"
"I liked the reception staff, they were very friendly and helpful 🙂"
Location was near to where family was
It ok
Good location and check in was prompt
Good service
"Very friendly staff. They speak Bengali and very helpful. Rooms are wide enough and toilet is clean and specious. A bit hard to find it but let me guide you. Just take the ally beside Axis bank ATM from main bazar road and keep going. Take the right turn in Y junction. When you are out of the ally, there is your hotel. Onnce you get to the property once it is easy to find. The ally is not clean though. But the hotel is nice."
Good price in the center.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Raj Mahal Inn, I stayed previously and would definitely return if visiting Delhi. The Staff are all very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is within minutes of the main bazaar but set back from the busy streets. I used their airport pickup service which was very reliable. A home from home."
"Very nice food 
Helpful staff , specially (front office Manager )
Very Safe to stay"
Welcomed well by staff
"Good location, hot shower, wifi working normally, helpful staff."
Because staff response

"Rooms are neat and clean, nearby to market area and new delhi station, staffs are also good and polite, value worth of money"
"The location is not in the main road but this is just a minute walk from the main road hence the rent is almost half. However, the staff took care of transferring our luggage. And the location is not middle of no where, there are other hotels and restaurants. The only thing is the hotel doesnot have 24x7 hot water. They turn the boiler on twice. However, on request, they turn it on as well. The hotel is safe for family."
Very bad service
"Absolutely loved my stay here! The room was luxurious, the food was delicious, and the staff was attentive and friendly."""
"The hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and the room was immaculate. Highly recommend!"
The hotel was conveniently located near all the attractions I wanted to visit. The room was cozy and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.

The location is good and the place is a great value for money. Their food service is also good and quick. Do try their omelet and paranthas.

"Newly built Hotel (2021 or so) , that's why the things were all in order."
"Arjun Bhaiya ✨ He was our valet. He is the sweetest being. he always has a smile on his face no matter how stressful his day is. We were two women in a new city and we were pretty scared naturally but he was so sweet to us. he gave us directions, he told us where we could find metro stations and how we were supposed to travel from one place to another. He even arranged autos for us since we were new in the city. He interacted with us and was very friendly and respectful! 10/10 to Arjun bhaiya. next time I come to Delhi I’m going to stay in the hotel mainly because of his service and good behaviour."

good location and good connectivity
the service was Good
" · I didn't like that fact that I had an offer for welcome drinks which was not provided even after asked twice, It's not about the drinks it's about how you provide the service.
It was my second visit , and same thing happened"
"The location is very near to ignou center hardly 1min 30second walk . It's very prime location for students who are enrolled in ignou courses, and also for those who are visiting delhi. Rooms and dormitory both are clean , Niv residence is full of artistic work and beautiful terrace kitchen."
Excellent staff. Good Amneties and Safe and calm stay for artlovers.
"It was a nice to stay at niv residencency ,Place is spacious ,comfortable & hygienic,staff behaviour was very polite and cooperative."
We stayed in this hotel for one night and it was one of the best experience
Kuch bhi sahi nahi tha...bilkul barbad hai...Koi yahaan mat jaana bhulkar bhi
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE
"Nothing works, no water. They switch off AC at night. No drinking water."
Absolutely nothing
" · The bed & room was not as shown in the website.
It was dirty and toilet and wash basin was not cleaned.
Lot of mosquitoes coming from the broken exhaust fan.
Bedsheets and pillow covers were smelling like it was not washed for months.
AC was not cooling and no fan was there. 
It was horrible experience out there. 
Don't know how Booking.com even promoting the hotel in its website."
"Affordable price.
If I compared to other hotels
This one is better than all."
Amazing experience stay at this unique yet luxurious hotel
"The staff at hotel in Roomshala were friendly, courteous, and helpful."
The hotel was wonderful. It was even better than expected. The price was amazing.
Very hygienic and clean rooms.
This hotel is very fantastic
Great location we really loved it
Hotel exceeded my expectations was spotless the staff was amazing and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in
 · Free breakfast was mentioned in the description but didn’t get it during the stay.
The check in and check out processes were smooth. The room was very nicely decorated with comfortable bed and head rests.
"- Location is just 2 mins walk away from Select City mall.

Good hotel with nice location
Family and couples can stay here. No negative behaviour.
My stay all the more convenient and enjoyable
very good i really enjoyed my stay here thanku mahesh we definitely come here again
"The reception faces the main road and is as shown on your booking.com page. After checking in, I was taken thru a back door, into a passage, with a lot of mysterious twists and turns, finally entering another building !!
I was asked to make the payment there at that counter. This counter was of another hotel (Classic, I think) and that opened into the alley behind Hotel International Inn. 
So to that extent I felt cheated. 
The interiors were shoddy. The room was spacious, but with old furniture, TV...slow Wi-Fi. The only thing is favour was the room was clean.
And the food was frightfully expensive!! absolutely 3-4 star rates."
They were not initially complying to the terms  of booking.
"Very neat clean and spacious hotel..... The hotel is at main road, at a location visible from all around. Nice entrance, rooms were very good. The manager and the staff was helpful. Nice Cozy place, in house restaurant Good Food."
Nice experience while short stay. The rooms are good and price are reasonable r its ok because the rooms are well maintained. Behaviour of the staff is quite nice.
"The rooms are spacious and have nice finish. Overall Neat & Clean property and Clean Amenities like linen, towels etc.
Food is good. Good for overnight stay."
The location and food were very good. The hotel was clean.
"The Location is Excellent: Very near to the airport. Taxis are easily available (I tried at 3.45AM).
I requested front desk for a quiet room and I was provided room on ground floor, which was clean and quiet at night. The AC was working well and hot water was available too. The washroom was clean too. 
Had a good sleep, as had to catch an early morning flight. 
Recommend this property to the travelers seeking a short stay for flights.
The only negative is that the Airtel signals were very poor in the room and had to go out for a call. But, maybe the other networks work well."
"The room is Good, the breakfast and the location is excellent"
Location was great.
location. spacious excellent food good staff
"i liked them. but, i was upset because not agreeing to my request of early check in. had to wait for two hours in a friends place. embarrassing"

Food is really good and decently priced, and you can order it at any time, we ordered at 2 AM. You really don't need to go out for food, if you can manage eating in your room, and staff is also really well mannered."
The location and food was superb.
Overall everything was ok.
"nice spacious room, good facilities"
Nothing...very bad behaviour of staff
Location not found and hotel staff not attending my call
"This hotel is fake, cheater have called me near to hotel through Google map and staff told me he'll be sending staff to receive me but swtiched off hi mobile than i went to another hotel. Due to G20 summit, govt abandoned many hotels who were working without license in delhi. Please investigate and do let me know about this thug hotel as this thug may spoil your name and fame."
they charged 1500 extra
Bad hotel staff ... Talk rudely charge 2000 extra when we reached
 · They refused to take me in when i call them they said my booking is canceled. and they asked me not to come. i called many times but answer was same

Only the location was fine.
" · The room shown in the picture is completely different from what they have provided. Never a good choice to stay there. During my 4 days stay, the room wasn't cleaned even for once. they did not even provide me with room keys!! 
The AC was continuously making sounds and it was irritating. Even after asking them again and again, the didn't give the TV remote. 
I had a complete bad experience there. Good for couples going there for hourly basis. 
Shall never go again!"

Breakfast was phenomenal"
"I liked the courtesy extended by the staff, one and all, good spread at the breakfast, we dined at the italian restuarant - was a good experience, at first the room was assigned was at the extreme corner of the hotel wit a city view, didn't like it, got it changed to a pool view, though again at the extreme end of the building, still did have a better with the pool view.
Overall was a pleasant experience during our 4 days stay"
"The location is fine. Staff are very hospitable and always smiling. Room is nice, bed is big and very comfortable. Breakfast and restaurant hours and long and convenient. They allowed me 1 hour early check-in."
We did not had breakfast because we wake up late.
Reception  staff was courteous.  I was upgraded.to a club floor.
"the staff are incredibly kind and helpful, the food is amazing, the rooms are perfectly designed, the beds are comfortable, and the swimming pool is one of the most beautiful pools I have seen. when I have one night in Delhi I will always stay there. travel in Delhi can be stressful. this hotel is an oasis."

"Excellent Breakfast...Especially we can order dosas :) My family is really happy.
Also very good customer service that or room got decorated because its one of my family member Birthday and it was a surprise for us."
Friendly staff. Clean hotel. Good breakfast.
Almost all facilities
" · In the morning when we arrived for breakfast, we were told that the restaurant, Nuke was fully occupied and we were taken to another restaurant. However, on my way to the other restaurant, we saw many spaces unoccupied and hence we were unable to understand the reason for the same. Is it because we were given a discounted rate by the reception staff for breakfast so a different breakfast type was assigned to us, while other guests enjoyed services at Nuke ? That seemed unfair as Nuke offered a large breakfast variety, whereas the other restaurant did not have too many breakfast options."
"The rooms are clean, spacious and neatly done up. The bathroom is comfortably large. Clean linen and towels. Decent breakfast as well."
I like the vibe of the room it was nice clean the in house food services was also nice.
Nice
The location is perfect.
Nothing is right there
"Location is ok. 
Staff helped me to relocate to a different hotel of The Orion group which was closeby and much better than this one without any cost impact. They also transferred my luggage. Still had to sleep at this place for 2 nights (instead of 7)"
the room service was very nice.
It was clean and comfortable
It has Blue Tokai cafe adjoining so that is good.
Nothing at all...
hotel  is very very nice  my stay in this hotel  very nice
No breakfast
"While arrived staff denied to carry all the baggage where entrance is very narrow and our Auto are not been able to enter. 
While departure staff asked me what is in your bag why it is so heavy"

 · The road nearby the hotel is too dirty.
I like the hotel service staff for foods only.
Nice hotel
" · Very dirty rooms, they give wrong address and location on booking.com
When we reach on location and call them 
They give us a different location in narrow streets 
Guys don’t be a fool to book a room in this hotel !!"
Very Nice Stay
This is group of cheaters who are posting different post by the name of several properties once you book and reach on booked hotel they inform that please come to totally different hotel  ( excuse google address is not correct )  you will force to stay in very unhygienic and  uncomfortable place or you are free to cancel and go wherever you want to go ( again  you are in a very difficult location in Delhi so you have to compromise)
Good
The AC was working and there was free bottled water for guests.
Nothing
Excellent  team ensured that our stay was comfortable.
Nothing is good
Location was good as it was near gaffar Market Karol bagh but no breakfast
" · Photos and pictures are fake , this room is not available for human living, very very very dirty I haven’t ever ever seen like it in my life during my visiting to 15 countries 
I swear that photos are editing by photoshop"
Not much to like except for Staff behaviour
Very hygienic rooms
Service was very attentive and though the rooms look a bit tired it has all the amenities.
The location is excellent for a trip to new delhi.
It is the worst hotel ever I had stayed in my life.
" · Must have Tv, 
Furniture all are demolish stage,
Toilets condition was very bad,
Taps , and flush are not working.
No ph or call bell to order any food and other."
"Excellent hotel,5 Star @ budget price.
Good breakfast+brand new property+amazing water pressure @shower #Aquagem#fittings.
Rain forest shower experience..
Centralised AC a plus point."
Very busy location and breakfast is not good.
"The AC, the bathroom and shwoer"
Breakfast only on orders but cutlery was not good quality. Location is in congested market where traffic jams are often.
Location was great….next to all amenities
The support staff was good . They were reachable at any moment
Good infrastructure and rooms.
" · Highly over priced for these congested rooms. Staff's are friendly but not that professional for a hospitality business. Biggest disadvantage is that they will ask for cash alone for room payments and not card or upi. Over all its not worthy for this price, space and amenities provided."
I like your hotel and staff
The beds were comfy and modern
"It was an amazing experience at hotel sunstar grand 
Staff was very good food was amazing and the best part is the room service of the hotel it now my best experience in delhi among all the  hotels I would suggest this property to any who wants comport and luxury at very low reasnabile  price thanks 🙏 hotel sunstar for making my trip successful to delhi"

Good property
Staff was nice. Wifi good.
"The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting downtown.."
I liked the staff and the hotel. There are some rooms more modern then others. The old ones  where I satyed need to be modernized. After all everything was nice!
"The hotel room was clean, nice and spacious. Breakfast offered with a wide variety of food. The staff were friendly and helpful.it was nice"
Staff was all very helpful. Decent for a 3 star hotel and walking distance to market area. Security person at the door and they do have cab service though it is much more expensive than getting and Uber. There is also a restaurant inside hotel which is convenient.
"Fish, Bangla Food prepared by mam and her kitchen unit."
Very clean and comfortable
"Room and bathroom was very clean, staff is very sweet, courteous, and helpful.
You can get breakfast and dinner if required.
Overall this is a great place for families and even solo females, the property and location is very safe, it is in a safe and good location, there is good security as well, and metro nearby."
Everything was well maintained and very clean. The service and hospitality was very good. The home cooked food is also a must try. The staff is polite and owners are very accommodating and respectful. The location is also really good

Disgusting
Great Hotel
Once we reach at the property perception got changed. Property was old but was maintained well. We were very excited for our upcoming stay at saket. More plus point is PVR cinemas at the opposite side. Hotel located at the main road. Staff were courteous and helpful.
Staff was friendly and very supportive.

Room has enough space and common area (living room) is also comfortable."
"Really good place. Wonderfully located in a posh Delhi locality that is safe, secure and clean. Easily accessible with plenty of transport options like Uber, Auto, Rickshaw etc. The room itself was well maintained and kept clean."
"Cleanliness, location and comfort"
"The location was peaceful and safe. I really loved the interior and size of the room. Also, the staff were really sweet and food was served well. The process was pretty convenient and smooth. Overall loved the experience"
"Piece of paradise in Delhi! Not in the center of all tourist attractions, but it's all a short Uber/Tuktuk ride away. Lodhi Gardens are about 15 mins and a 100-150 rupees ride, so really close. The area is very green, a true oasis! Also, those are private rooms with a shared living room, but you don't feel restricted in any way. Most nights, it was just me and my husband using the entire space. Very spacious and has good sound protection. Everything is extremely tastefully decorated, and breakfasts are delicious!"
Location was fantastic and the staff were a great team! Plus the place was pristine clean and well maintained!
very good place to stay in Dehli!
"The staff is always very helpful and attentive, the rooms are sparkling clean, and the breakfast was plentiful. WiFi works perfectly, and the hotel has a power generator so, there was a blackout at some point but the power generator automatically kicked in a few seconds later and everything kept working perfectly fine."
"Clean, spacious, good locality."
"Stay was good, room also good 👍"
Super
Breakfast is good and location is good
Nice front office people and clean hotel
Day time staff were courteous and quite helpful
It is beside main road and easy to find out. Everyone was helpful. No need to find out specific person for specific problem.
"They helped us a lot with some aspect, for which I am very pleased. ready to help and eager to rectify any issues. overall very happy with the stay"
Everything was close
"Breakfast was good
Location .The road leading to hotel has heavy traffic"
 · Intercom was not functioning properly
I love the location. The rooms are clean. The staff is polite and good in behaviour. I would love to visit again.
"Good location, very helpful and nice staff, clean room"
"Overall a good place to stay with plenty of character and a good location. It's easy to get downtown, whether by Metro or tuk tuk. Many local shops and stalls around for food. Staff were really helpful and friendly. I also thought the food via room service was very good and reasonably priced."

Amazing hospitality and friendly  Loved their services. Would surely recommend. Room was amazing and food was also nice. All staff are very supportive and always ready to help
" · The management and customer-care.
After having tried many times to reach out the hotel, by phone and email (as the payng system didn't work, and they kept answering with auto-response), I went directly there. I arrived and the staff didn't speak English. Thankfully my taxi driver spoke hindi, and I was able to understand that the Hotel did not accept foreigners. But they do not share this information online, neither on their website nor Booking.com. They did not apologize, nor helped me in any way: the person at the reception kept saying ""contact customer care"". So, after reaching the hotel after a long journey (I was coming from Rishikesh), I was without accommodation. 
I can try to understand the policy of not accepting foreign people, but it would be great to have a disclaimer on their website and on any online platform for reservation, as my reservation has been accepted, even providing the number of my passport."
This hotel is closed. A deserted building can be seen. I could not stay. Please don't mislead through your App to the customers.

Room was very nice and very clean . Service also good. Housekeeping staff also very helpful and polite.
Friendly staff. Clean hotel. Beautiful atmosphere inside and outside around that part of the city.
The hotel was wonderful. It was even better than expected. The price was amazing. There were great restaurants within walking distance
The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was spacious and clean. The vintage aesthetics were awesome.
Everything was great at this hotel.. amazing staff that is friendly and makes customers feel welcome.
They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early at like 10am. We got to hotel super early and I didn’t wanna wait. So this was a big plus. The service was exceptional as well. Would definitely send a friend there.
"Excellent management humble staff, rooms are well maintained with all required facilities. frent desk staff and room service 24 hrs available. Food very testy and located on very good location easy to find.
I recommend to everyone."
"Was put up in another property NOT hotel AIR INN. 
Immediately on arrival they demanded for payment of Rs.2800/-. After it was paid I was shown a room with a window AC that was rattling and making a lot of noise. After complaining I was shown another room Room No.005 that was bigger and cleaner but the toilet seat was broken. No toilet paper was available. They said that the toilet seat would be repaired in a few days. All the fittings in the toilet were not clean and appeared old and rusted. The name of the property where I was directed to and had to stay at was BADAL INN  situated at B 4 / 144, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi- 110029."

"First day disappointed, second day good"
room was small for the price paid but okay can stay
The locality is good. Full of shopes and near to metro station. But location shown in map is not correct.
The bed was comfortable and it was very central.
Staff response
very close to metro facility and nice staff
"The hotal staff   and host of the hotal  was
Very nice 👌"
They have taken ectra money and put a service tax of almost 38%.Which is worst thing I have ever seen.
Nice hotel ..near r k asharam metro station
"perfect location , cleean nice rooms verry helpful and frendly staff,"
"A very good budget option. Great location, quiet but close to Paharganj. 
Reliable and professional staff. Safe as a solo female traveler.
Good wifi, hot water etc"
Staff are pretty friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean.
"Hotel is ok but the description of the room on the website is far from accurate: my single deluxe room had not electric kettle, no wardrobe, nothing apart from a bed, two chairs, a very little table, two very little soaps, two small sample of shampoo, one glass  and that's it. I would not call the room ""deluxe""..."
"The staff were friendly and kind to us (I cannot remember the names, but thank you!). There was always a guard at the front door and a few staff members at the hotel reception so that we could feel protected from outside."
"Exceptional room! Well appointed with very comfortable bed!
Mini fridge worked very well and an absolute godsend in Delhi's summer heat!"
"I booked the hotel the same day I arrived. I had previously stayed there so I knew it would be good. Easy, quick, good location. Thank you!"
"Location, staff behavior, cleanliness"
Good location and Helpful staff
"Best decent hotel in Pagarganj and very centrally located near shops, metro and trainstation. Good value for money, no luxury but everything you need with some small extras like fridge and kettle and very clean. Don’t be put off by the funny room décor, this hotel was good before covid and it is still good with new beds and the same friendly staff, standing out from all hotels around. Coming here for years for work and still can’t be beaten."
the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. they give everything that we need. I can really feel the hospitality.
"Pros for this hotel, location is good,easy acssesbility for cabs, hospital & inspite of being on main road itw's not noisy, Manager Mr Ajay was courteous n gentle person. Chenk in /out time were flexible,allowed early check-in n late check out."
 · They need to improve the internet connectivity in hotel. Not enough natural lighting in the room.
Hotel was good as expected. Hotel staffs were also very cooperative. Located at a very prime area of karol bagh. Will book the same hotel for the next time.
" · The reception area is not attractive,need 
 to improve the  interior of reception as this is the first attraction, where all guest enter, rest all things are ok."
Had good time and good sleep
"I had a good experience staying at this hotel, nice location, nice hotel staff"
Fine for an overnight stay. Staff were accommodating and helpful. Room was spacious and clean with exception of the bathroom

"Room was spacious, all utilities were working. Breakfast was delicious if you are a fan of aloo Paratha and chole Puri."
"The room was not very clean, the images shown online are very different to how the room looks"
The breakfast was typical Indian with good options for omelette. It took some time to get the breakfast and the only place to eat it was on the bed in the room. There was not really any good shared area to sit or spend time. Someone from the staff was also sitting and smoking cigarettes in one of the few areas where it seemed possible to sit and eat breakfast.

Breakfast is just okay. What i really like the most is the staff are very accommodating and hospitable and friendly. Kudos to your staff mr garvit for helping us through out. We enjoyed our 4 days staycation. And the place is really convenient to  the pearson vu exam center.
Personel was very kind and helpful. Hotel was clean and comfortable. Localization is perfect. I highly recommend this place in New Delhi!
Property is aesthetically pleasing and modern with Intergration of digital aspects like online check in and communicating with text for what you need. Linen and beds were clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly.
Good
"The location was really good. It was really close to   the testing center.  The staff were really nice specially Vikash, who made an effort to ensure that the remaining of my stay would be comfortable and peaceful by moving me to another room once one had become available. I also appreciate the transport package that they had offered when I told them that I wanted to travel to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. They really made sure that I would be safe and well looked after."
Lovely modern lobby with nice friendly staff. Very helpful and gave us advice regarding travelling to Delhi monuments. Staff were very polite and did not try to pressure sell any products/services.
The room was good and clean. The bed was comfortable. Location is also good walking distance to the beach and many cafes nearby to eat.

"Room was spacious, all utilities were working. Breakfast was delicious if you are a fan of aloo Paratha and chole Puri."
"The room was not very clean, the images shown online are very different to how the room looks"
The breakfast was typical Indian with good options for omelette. It took some time to get the breakfast and the only place to eat it was on the bed in the room. There was not really any good shared area to sit or spend time. Someone from the staff was also sitting and smoking cigarettes in one of the few areas where it seemed possible to sit and eat breakfast.

"The location was really good. It was really close to   the testing center.  The staff were really nice specially Vikash, who made an effort to ensure that the remaining of my stay would be comfortable and peaceful by moving me to another room once one had become available. I also appreciate the transport package that they had offered when I told them that I wanted to travel to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. They really made sure that I would be safe and well looked after."

"Everything was very clean and orderly, and the staff was EXEPTIONALLY friendly and relaxed, always ready to smile and help.. The chai and food we ordered was also good.
The room was very quiet, a wonderful rest after the bustle of Pahar Ganj.
Ankush and Gauran from the reception desk deserve a special mention. The seem to.never sleep, but nontheless were always in a very good and pleasant mood.
We will be back for sure"

"Our stay at FabExpress V4 Residency was one of best experiences.
Best services provided at prime location With supportive Staff especially the receptionist Vishal for his guidance and faster check out.
Highly recommended"
"This hotel staffs were polite and ALWAYS ready to assist you (Aman at reception) (Pawan, Mukesh & Naeem at Restaurant) Rooms were clean, spacious but bathroom was little small. Breakfast & dinner buffet spread is limited but food is really tasty and entire restaurant is clean and spacious. Small fitness centre was fine and clean daily morning. Overall stay was good."
Decent property experience. Was there a very small stay but i gotta say that the hospitality and everything was great. I liked the food too. I’m impressed by how your chefs are so friendly with the guest. I could that they genuinely cared and didn’t put on a good act just to get some numbers. Good going Fab.👍
Service
we were a little early as had a early morning flight. we did not had to wait till 12pm to get our rooms. the rooms were not ready on our arrival but were given to us as soon as they were cleaned and ready for us. breakfast spread was just right - not too large and not too small. food quality was also good and tasty.
" · Small and congested room with no proper maintenance. Wall papers peeling off, blow dryer not working, no windows in the room. No housekeeping service for the 2 days v had stayed. Limited choice of items in breakfast  and expensive too. Overall not so pleasant experience."
THEY DID NOT GIVE ME AN INVOICE - ASKED AT CHECKIN AND CHECKOUT _ THEY DID NOT - SAID THEY WILL PROVIDE ON WHATSAPP BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED EITHER.
Good Options in Breakfast. Location is good for staying close to airport.
"Almost nothing, it looked good only in pictures"

Lovely staff ...super helpful ... room plunge pool with view was super awesome
Location and building
"i have now stayed there twice and on both occassions - i was alone however, was involved in an event where the entire party was staying there. The pool rooms are amazing and cannot recommend them enough - i loved being able to have a dip in the pool in the privacy of my own room. the bathrooms were great as well. Cleanliness was amazing and actually honesty of the cleaning staff was second to none - i left a ring out by mistake and it was never touched. I preferred the smaller rooms as they were cosy and perfect as a solo traveller and the small touches in the hotel were very nice."
We loved our room and private plunge pool - see photos
 · felt the room is on driveway with no privacy
large well maintained with a unique design
Room was grand. In room dining facilities were good.
Beautiful attention to detail

Your staff members
Manager Ashish was very helpful and nice
Exllent
"Front office staff behaviour is appreciable. Particularly one manager  Mr. Deepak was quite helpful and wel behaved person. In my case I checked out my room on 23/ 12 at 5 am as I had my train to katra, but unfortunately Vande Bharat train was cancelled by Railway as kissan blocked railway tracks in Punjab and I had to come back to hotel with my wife. Then Mr. Deepak , the manager of the hotel said me that as we had just checked out and original check out time is 11 am so we can again stay in our room upto 11am and comfortably make an alternative arrangement to go to katra by bus that night for Mata Vaishno devi darshan. Offcourse I had to pay for an extra day as I stayed upto 6pm. Thank you Deepak ji. I will again come and already booked from 26/12 to 27/12 on my way back from katra to Delhi and to spend a day before flying to my State, Assam."

Hospitable Staff. Food is decent.
"Restaurant staff were friendly and good, and the chef is very good - delicious home style Indian cooking - I loved it. The hotel is clean and organised, and I felt safe. It has all the basic amenities and even has a gym that I used. It was close to where I needed to be everyday, and I would stay again if I needed to come back to the same place."
Simple rooms.
The location was good according to my needs.. food taste was good.
Checking in and checking out process was really smooth
"Even though buffet was not available, the food was good"
"Having stayed several years back at Ginger hotels in Bangalore and Pune, was expecting similar levels of quality of rooms and service but that did not seem to be the case. I would only assume that COVID had changed things and I am sure this is a temporary situation and things would definitely improve. The team serving breakfast were very accommodating and helpful as also the person servicing the rooms"
"Excellent hotel with best service in town. I have travelled the world but the hospitality seen here is fabulous. Small suggestion - place minimum amenities in spa and we'll trained staff. I am very regular at this property and the people here attracts me to come back again and again here Special mention to Abinash Pramanik and his team at front desk, Satya B from housekeeping. Will come back again and all the best."
"It was a great experience to stay FabExpress Station II a peaceful atmosphere and clean & Large room ,the staff is very polite and courteous

Special thanks to everyone for the beautiful gesture and the World class service

The staff is very welcoming and helpful."
It's just perfect..sound sleep..good food.... excellent shower..
Good location
The place was conveniently close to the metro station and in general Saket is a nice area (the place was also in a gated community so quite safe at night). The hot water was good.
Very near to metro station

Great people.... eager to help.

"Property is good, but worst maintenance."
I really liked the professional attitude and the personal touch of the staff to make my stay much more comfortablr that id expected.
I have been regular to this property and excellent property. Very well trained and friendly staff. Sparkling clean hotel. Excellent food and room service is quick. Room size is big with big toilet and shower area.

"The stay was fantastic... we have stayed for one night, the rooms are pretty clean. breakfast is superb with many varieties and the front desk and room service staff are very cooperative. thank you very much... i recommend all to come here and stay this hotel.."
The room was a clean and great size.. Front desk staff and restaurant staff really excellent friendly very good.. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was its reasonable price I really enjoyed my stay!
"If you get this hotel room for 1000 or so please book it.. if you are travelling from airport don't listen to the taxi people who says the location is not that good or hotel is not well maintained. We had similar experience.. the taxi people try to lure you saying that they will show you a better accommodation at better price, but they will do that for commision from other hotels. Don't listen to them. The other hotels might charge you extra. The staff are helpful here and they provide better breakfast. It's actually 3 km from the airport."
"Everything was clean, and the service was nice. I didn't know what to expect being my first time in India, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was as clean as Camper to other hotel i stayed in India"
The property is worth the value. Being close to the airport was the ultimate factor for me.
" · Everything was Same as it shows in the pictures so I'm glad for that, but the location pinned on the website is wrong. so reach them to get the exact location before you going to check-in and don't forget to mention your hotel name they have different hotels. otherwise you have to spend more money for the uber than the hotel charges."
"Clean room, polite staff, good service, and  value for money"
"The washrooms were very clean and that was the best part, no stench and hygienic. That stood out for me personally.
The room size was sufficient too. And, the vitala mentioned in the description were all available. The staff was friendly too and very helpful in answering the queries we have regarding local travelling. 
Overall, it was good."
"Great rooms, good service, happy to stay again, the staff and service was  in their service. We really enjoyed the ambience and stay. Recommended for everyone"
it's location was on road easy to access public transport ... cheapest online in comparison to nearby few hotels...
Nothing special
location
There is nothing to be like here
 · No kitchen service.breakfast was provided from outside which was not upto the standard.
" · I was going to give a decent review for the stay but here's what happened - I get a call from the hotel manager after my checkout asking me for the confirmation no. and pin. Then I see that somehow the rating is 10! If you wanted help with a rating, you should have asked. But, you shouldn't have done it on my behalf. I might have rated the stay as 7 but now its a 4 after this behavior.  
Also, irrespective of the class of the hotel, you expect the bedsheets without strangers hair on it. Getting a mosquito repellant took more than 1 hour and a repeat call. If you want a 10 rating, provide an experience worthy of 10."
Nice stay
"This booking was made on behalf of my daughter after she found herself without passport or any credit cards or debit cards and little cash. A long story. 
I made the booking from the uk and after a few emails and speaking to the extremely helpful duty manager.    
We were able to find a solution to my daughters predicament and get her checked in. 
As a parent I cannot express my gratitude to the staff at the holiday inn. 
Her stay has been comfortable. 
My mind is at peace knowing that she is safe and in good hands. 
Thank you so much"
"The hotel was very clean, the room was nice, they let us have the room earlier than check-in time."
" · The ac in room was not setting properly, l requested someone from help desk to have a look but no one came to fix."
Close to airport.
Security guard has misbehaved with us he is thinking that he is the owner of that hotel very poor condition
Location is just perfect for travelers to catch international flights.
Excellent
Overall experience ok

Avaragely good hotel .stuff  with location is good .but food preparation is not up to the mark
The hotel facilities are very good and the room was almost the same as the photos. The food is also reasonable and tastes good.

I have been coming to this hotel for many years and will continue every time I visit India.  Very safe for solo female travellers too.

I really liked that they have a desk in the lobby where you can purchase train tickets among other transportation means that saves you the trip to the trainstation and being that you can’t purchase them online, then this was a god send. Thanks again."

Good hospitality and location
The attention to detail of the staff is incredible. The property is so beautiful and full of history. Pool side is very romantic and a lovely hideaway in an otherwise busy buzzing city. Highly recommend !!
"We booked the 2 room apartment, and it was just amazing, comfortable & luxurious.
The breakfast was delicious, the pool and the spa were wonderful, and everyone we met from the staff were so friendly and helpful. We had such a wonderful stay!
We definitely recommend Taj Mahal hotel :)"

The property is grand and oozes luxury in every corner.
Truly 5 star experience. Excellent view from room. Well pleased with hotel. Would definitely recommend.
"Best customer service and experience ive had.
I ended up staying for nearly one month at this hotel.
Thanks Mr Shahjah, Rahul Piyosh managers for hosting me and giving me some great upgrades always polite and super professional. Even letting me use facilities post checkout after a very lengthy stay. Thanks Mr Roopak in the gym i saw a massive difference from our daily sessions defo part of the reason i extended.  Miss Priya great massages relieving my soreness after the gym and feeling reenergised. Thanks to Mr Gosh Aruhi and the lounge team for serving me everyday preparing my order already out of knowing from the day before. Superb attention to details. Thanks to tashi and yamini at front desk for also helping me. Pool was peaceful pleasant  clean huge and very relaxing. Loved the free suite upgrade suite best sleep ever."
The staffs were very polite and helpful specially the machan resturant waitress was very spontaneous and the business center gentelman was very helpful with prints of court documents i needed. Thanks Taj always makes me smile.b
"Everything was great but above all the kindness of the host, Mr Pankaj."
"The most welcoming host waited for us already for the check-in and served us some welcoming tea. There was a lot of information provided about where to go out for dinner or coffee. The host even walked with us to an area with many restaurants and made various suggestions for dinner choices.
The accommodation is simple but cozy and comes with everything needed for a short stay."
The location was perfect to make a quick visit of the city. The small private kitchen was very useful. Mr.Pankaj is an experienced host who knows how to put the guests at ease and was also very helpful.
Friendly and helpful propreitor and staff. Location close to good Bengali eateries.
The host! He is the best of the accommodation. Our stay in Delhi was enjoyable thanks to all his tips and recommendations. He goes above and beyond to help you out!
"Pankaj, the host, was incredibly kind and always went the extra mile to help. His recommendations were spot-on, making it easy for us to navigate New Delhi as a first-time visitor.
Located in a quieter area, we felt right at home during our entire stay. The location was still close enough of the city for exploring Delhi's highlights and there were some great restaurants nearby. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.
I highly recommend Tatvamasi Homestay to anyone visiting Delhi. A big thank you for Pankaj our friend, for the amazing hospitality!"
This is the place to stay if you're in Delhi!  The amazing host and his family will make you feel at home.
Staff and cleanliness
"The owner Pankaj is very helpful and hospitable. He helped us with everything we needed, from finding a shop to buy sim card, recommended nice and clean places to eat because it was our first time in India and which sights to visit. He arranged also early check in because we were tired from a long flight. He was really someone you need when you arrive to a new country. We are very grateful to have him there. The room was clean and cosy with all you need. Very quiet. Supermarkets and restaurants are a short walk away."
Warm and hospitable hosts. Clean room with everything required already there. I stayed for 1 night because next night was already booked.
we were a little early as had a early morning flight. we did not had to wait till 12pm to get our rooms. the rooms were not ready on our arrival but were given to us as soon as they were cleaned and ready for us. breakfast spread was just right - not too large and not too small. food quality was also good and tasty.
" · Small and congested room with no proper maintenance. Wall papers peeling off, blow dryer not working, no windows in the room. No housekeeping service for the 2 days v had stayed. Limited choice of items in breakfast  and expensive too. Overall not so pleasant experience."
THEY DID NOT GIVE ME AN INVOICE - ASKED AT CHECKIN AND CHECKOUT _ THEY DID NOT - SAID THEY WILL PROVIDE ON WHATSAPP BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED EITHER.
Good Options in Breakfast. Location is good for staying close to airport.
"Easy to locate, Helpful staff,"
 · Great Hotel
Nice property clean and well

"Great Hotel , nice staff."

Good housekeeping and good staff
We stayed in this hotel for one night and it was one of the best experience
Kuch bhi sahi nahi tha...bilkul barbad hai...Koi yahaan mat jaana bhulkar bhi
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE
"Nothing works, no water. They switch off AC at night. No drinking water."
Absolutely nothing
" · The bed & room was not as shown in the website.
It was dirty and toilet and wash basin was not cleaned.
Lot of mosquitoes coming from the broken exhaust fan.
Bedsheets and pillow covers were smelling like it was not washed for months.
AC was not cooling and no fan was there. 
It was horrible experience out there. 
Don't know how Booking.com even promoting the hotel in its website."

If I compared to other hotels
This one is better than all."

very good i really enjoyed my stay here thanku mahesh we definitely come here again
"The reception faces the main road and is as shown on your booking.com page. After checking in, I was taken thru a back door, into a passage, with a lot of mysterious twists and turns, finally entering another building !!
I was asked to make the payment there at that counter. This counter was of another hotel (Classic, I think) and that opened into the alley behind Hotel International Inn. 
So to that extent I felt cheated. 
The interiors were shoddy. The room was spacious, but with old furniture, TV...slow Wi-Fi. The only thing is favour was the room was clean.
And the food was frightfully expensive!! absolutely 3-4 star rates."
They were not initially complying to the terms  of booking.
"Very neat clean and spacious hotel..... The hotel is at main road, at a location visible from all around. Nice entrance, rooms were very good. The manager and the staff was helpful. Nice Cozy place, in house restaurant Good Food."
Nice experience while short stay. The rooms are good and price are reasonable r its ok because the rooms are well maintained. Behaviour of the staff is quite nice.
"The rooms are spacious and have nice finish. Overall Neat & Clean property and Clean Amenities like linen, towels etc.
Food is good. Good for overnight stay."
The location and food were very good. The hotel was clean.
"The Location is Excellent: Very near to the airport. Taxis are easily available (I tried at 3.45AM).
I requested front desk for a quiet room and I was provided room on ground floor, which was clean and quiet at night. The AC was working well and hot water was available too. The washroom was clean too. 
Had a good sleep, as had to catch an early morning flight. 
Recommend this property to the travelers seeking a short stay for flights.
The only negative is that the Airtel signals were very poor in the room and had to go out for a call. But, maybe the other networks work well."
"The room is Good, the breakfast and the location is excellent"
Location was great.
"Stayed for the second time, and everything was as good as it was a year ago. Rooms, toilets, food, everything is great. Food is really good and decently priced, and you can order it at any time, we ordered at 2 AM. You really don't need to go out for food, if you can manage eating in your room, and staff is also really well mannered."
The location and food was superb.
Overall everything was ok.

"Hotel was very good, room was nice."
Location was good.
"The staff are so polite,friendly ."
Nothing was good in this property. Booking.com should be ashamed of advertising this property as 4 star.
The property seemed to be newly built and clean
"Very poor room service, staff are not professional, tv not working, food quality very bad."
" · Outside food was not allowed, most of the items in the food menu are not available. Room condition was not good, toilet & bathroom are dirty."

Location not found and hotel staff not attending my call
"This hotel is fake, cheater have called me near to hotel through Google map and staff told me he'll be sending staff to receive me but swtiched off hi mobile than i went to another hotel. Due to G20 summit, govt abandoned many hotels who were working without license in delhi. Please investigate and do let me know about this thug hotel as this thug may spoil your name and fame."
they charged 1500 extra
Bad hotel staff ... Talk rudely charge 2000 extra when we reached

"Very nice place, clean, well furnished. There is a restaurant with great food and a co-working space. Wifi worked perfectly. The staff was very friendly, good location. I was very happy with my stay and would come back again."

"The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and have a fantastic old time charm.
We got to check in at the hotel very early and this was a big plus. The service was exceptional.
Excellent family hotel in the area.
The staff were amazing. Every staff member we encountered from check in/reception to cleaning/maintenance to restaurant staff were delightful and eager to help. They went over and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Thank you!"
Only the location was fine.
" · The room shown in the picture is completely different from what they have provided. Never a good choice to stay there. During my 4 days stay, the room wasn't cleaned even for once. they did not even provide me with room keys!! 
The AC was continuously making sounds and it was irritating. Even after asking them again and again, the didn't give the TV remote. 
I had a complete bad experience there. Good for couples going there for hourly basis. 
Shall never go again!"

The host there are really welcoming and nice people."
Staff behaviour and also good property
Staff were polite and helpful. Rooms were clean. Complimentary breakfast was also good. And the complementary yoga sessions were really helpful.

"Breakfast was excellent. Everyday they used to call us when we did not go for the breakfast. The staffs were nice and the decoration was excellent. I would highly recommend the place for all the travelers there. In addition , I found the security Guard very polite and humble and was on his duty even at 2am when we came from the tour."
The only thing I liked is the cleanliness of wash room and the size of washroom.
Ok
"Break fast is ok. But after 8:30am only it will ready.
Lift is under renovation, not working."

the room service was very nice.
It was clean and comfortable
It has Blue Tokai cafe adjoining so that is good.

"Localização excellent and fair price. Good relation cost vs benefit. They have a very convenient common living room in each floor with water,  complimentary snacks and soft drinks."

Mr. Harpreet managed the hospitality very well and took care of the entire requests we came to him. I appreciate his attitude and behavior. The location seems to be easy to reach. Overall friendly and the rooms were decent and neat when we arrived. there were no water or geyser issues.
 · Manager was extremely unprofessional and rude that was sitting around 6pm at hotel with long hair.
The location offers best connectivity to airport.
the staff was so helpful. they even provided me i phone charger. however it might not be very clean if you come from eu countries. sheets were old.
Normal
Very bad property
Location
Location is good. Food is ok.
Excellent  team ensured that our stay was comfortable.
Nothing is good
Location was good as it was near gaffar Market Karol bagh but no breakfast
" · Photos and pictures are fake , this room is not available for human living, very very very dirty I haven’t ever ever seen like it in my life during my visiting to 15 countries 
I swear that photos are editing by photoshop"
Not much to like except for Staff behaviour
Very hygienic rooms
Service was very attentive and though the rooms look a bit tired it has all the amenities.
The location is excellent for a trip to new delhi.
It is the worst hotel ever I had stayed in my life.
" · Must have Tv, 
Furniture all are demolish stage,
Toilets condition was very bad,
Taps , and flush are not working.
No ph or call bell to order any food and other."
"I must say, it exceeded my expectations. From the moment I arrived, the staff was warm and welcoming, ensuring a seamless check-in process. The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay."

"The best hotel in Dwarka. I have been to a couple but none have the hospitality, ambience and features in comparison to Vivanta. Outstanding experience and will visit again!"
Room are spacious and comfortable
"Everything was simply perfect! Inside, the hotel is comfortable with great services. The room is stylish. Outside, the position is perfect to reach the airport, also by metro"
Rooms are clean and big.
"1. Front desk phone receiver don’t picks phone, could get only after several calls. 
2. Transportation (conciorge) service not good. Instead providing alternate airport transport services from hotel, they advise to book by the customers themselves and asks to book using Ola and Uber.
3. Front desk services to be more Tata type of effectiveness, I never saw it.
I mentioned to hotel staff that we want to help Tata staying in their hotels or using any
of their business in India, but just because of some employees different interests, egos and unprofessional attitudes,Tata’s name and fame should not be downgraded. 
I think, if employees are reorganised with quality personality and trainings, Vivanta Dwaraka New Delhi would do much better name and fame."
"The room was clean and spacious. The breakfast buffet was delicious, with a variety of options. The staff were attentive and went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable."
"Breakfast and dinner were excellent. The hotel was clean and the staff were polite and as such there was no difficulty in check-in.

"J House was a very nice place to stay in. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, check in took 5 minutes and we got our room which was very clean and tidy. It was a great deal compared to the price paid. It was very quiet and you can get a very good sleep after a long day roaming Delhi. Would totally recommend this place."
Open space on trace was the best with the plane landing view
"I stayed only 1 night. It was fine: clean, comfy, close to the airport."
I had a lovely time at Jhouse and appreciated how well the staff looked after me. The roof top is amazing and if it wasn’t so hot I would have spent my entire time there.
"Excellent staff, the boy always wear the smile and willing to help 
Safe place for the female travelers"
Comfortable stay. Among many hostels i find J house very clean. You get to meet like minded travelers as well. Staffs are very supportive.
Everything. Ujjol and shwapan dada is very helpful and friendly. If possible in summer extend air conditioner timing please. Thank you!
"We stayed in the deluxe room, which was extremely comfy, a good sized bathroom and nicely decorated.  Lovely having kettle & coffee, chai sachets + freely available cold water. The staff were super friendly and helpful. The kitchen had everything you could need - stove, micro, toaster, fridge, plates, cutlery and was clean and tidy. The common room was comfy with some books/guitar, but as everyone else says, the rooftop was the highlight with the plants, comfy seats, fans & plants  - loved sitting there to read or eat one of our many Zomato orders. The hostel is located in a typical Indian neighborhood which I found fab, loved seeing the hustle & bustle. It's pretty close to the airport which is handy, and quite a few attractions."
"The rooftop is really nice.
My room was good too"
"The personnel is really friendly and helpfull.
The location is good, the accomodation is nice"
Nothing.
Great hotel with great facilities and staff. The room was very comfortable and clean. Food was good and everything else looked fine. The staff was happy to help us with everything we needed.
Great location for the airport and aero city food court
"Well additional lights shd be added on the ceiling,  as it is not adequate ."

Then in the Breakfast Ravi Chef took our best care .soo thankyouu soo much guys for this lovee"
"Bedroom was large, nicely decorated & very comfortable - the bathroom contained a large Stark bathtub which is rare anywhere in India & was bliss!"
The Pullman property itself boasts of beautiful architecture and design and there can be no denying of its beauty. The staff were absolutely incredible and attentive. The communication was fantastic for everything from checkout to breakfast to room service and other facilities. We felt welcomed in the true sense of the word. The vibe and ambience was cozy and eclectic. We enjoyed the beautiful spread at the buffet breakfast and the edgy architecture in the chill out space.
Bathroom was super clean. Check-out was fast
"Amazingly maintained property, exceptionally clean, extremely hospitable staff. In a service industry which is deteriorating by the day, the hotel and staff is working hard towards customer delight. It is my anniversary week and the hotel ensured I had a smooth checkin and the room was provided as per our specifications. Travelling with a baby was made easy with the very supportive staff both in the lobby and the resident floors."

"The reception staff was very nice, the bathroom was clean and dry... so nice!"
"The reception/lobby area was noisy at times. I would suggest everyone to wear ear plugs if you don’t like the sound. 
Rohit bhai is the best. Whatever you need just ask him. He will somehow solve your problem 100%."
"I have stayed in this place for multiple times, I must say it's a very nice place, safe and sound neighborhood, and the staffs are amazing, specially Mr. Rohit is a kind and helpful gentleman! Keep up the good spirit guys, I would definitely visit again!"
Nice friendly staff. Always polite and willing to help. Clean rooms. Would definetly recommend going here. Thank you for the amazing time.

"The staff behavior was not nice... I visited the property after confirmed booking for early check in but when i reached there the hotel staff told me to pay extra money for early chrck in.. Then i told them that, let me call the booking. Com customer care.. Then he reduced the money."
Very bad rooms conditions..
 · After booking they said.. Room not available.. Given another hotel at higher rate
"Nothing they all are goones.
Please don't go to this hotel ever. They thug people.
I booked in their hotel and when I arrive at night they said they have no room available and I have to go out and search rooms at night 2AM in Delhi."

"Good location, near to Airport, clean"
"Our recent stay at Hotel Grand Godwin was truly exceptional. As two couples traveling from the USA, we were pleasantly surprised by the exceptional service and value for money this hotel offered. Our request for an early morning airport pickup was flawlessly executed, setting the tone for a wonderful stay.
The hotel's commitment to cleanliness and hygiene was evident from the moment we stepped into our rooms. Spacious and well-maintained, the accommodations provided a comfortable haven after a day of exploring. For a quieter experience, we recommend opting for rooms at the back of the property.
A standout feature was the efficient and high-speed WiFi, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout our stay. The on-site Café Brownie emerged as our favorite spot for a rejuvenating cup of coffee, offering a cozy ambiance within the hotel premises.
The buffet breakfast spread was impressive, catering to diverse palates and offering a great start to our mornings. The variety and quality of food left us thoroughly satisfied.
Hotel Grand Godwin exceeded our expectations in every way. It provided a fantastic value for the price, delivering on its promise of cleanliness, comfort, and top-notch service. We highly recommend this hotel to fellow travelers seeking a delightful and hassle-free stay in the heart of the city."
 · Bathroom is little conjusted
"The place is great. Friendly and nice help. They organized ower total trip. My husband’s birthday was celebrated with some nice surprises. Some nice food and a birtdaycake with candles. We came here this year again because we where positive about ower earlier India travel in 2018. 
And now looking forward for the coming trip."
"Grand Godwin Hotel is handily located close to central Delhi and New Delhi Railway Station.  The room and bed were comfortable and it was lovely, at last, to get a hot shower that worked. The staff were fantastic,  particularly in looking out for our needs and showing empathy when my wife became  ill."
"The beds were the most comfortable I have had in India.
The men on the front desk were attentive and the bell boys were helpful."
"I liked the big shower cabin and beautifull stairs. The doorman was opening hotel's big doors. The breakfast staff was very attentive. Localisation also good, 5 min walk from the railway station."
The room was spacious and location is perfect to all major attractions. It is mostly covered with hotels and tourists.
"proximity to local restaurant.
Naveen at front desk a true gentleman and always helpful"
"The staff was amazingly friendly, helpful and cared about my well being. The room was clean,  bed  was comfortable.  The buffet breakfast was super tasty."
Good emplacement. Good driver from the airport.
Nice hotel but bed room not clean
 · Blanket are not clean n even pillows n no dental kit washroom is nit proper working they said they will change the room but they don't
"Everything was great about the property however ac was not working, which is the only thing we did not like. Has to sleep with fan only and it was very hot.  But staff,food, location, is good😊"
"Room. In house kitchen, restaurant"
Location & service.
 · Not work tv  &  not issue  PLAID
Hotel staff is really good and it's in the main market.
"Nothing, Staff is poor, rooms are bad, too much noise and music unnecessarily and disturbance by the staff."
Only the location
 · Quality of the room was not up to the mark...
Dirty bed sheet.Bad odour in the room
Nothing only location
Nothing...as they didn't allow us to get the room since we paid online
Dirty place with no maintenance
"All of the staff was excellent, especially thanks to Kabir and Anu for really making sure that all was smooth, pleasant, and social. All of the tours was worth it, and the social engagement was stunning.
The accomodation itself was not top notch, and the place is only as clean as you could expect from a hostel in this price range.
But all of that was just as good as it had to be, and the rest was just excellent!"
The vibe and also the simple but amazing energy in the hotel
#NAME?
"The staff made this hostel just a very nice experience. Good vibes, nice people staying here. Very helpful staff that organizes tours in Old Delhi and New Delhi. I RECOMMEND THIS STAY! :-)"
 · Rainy season is very difficult to walk around and take transportation
"Great staff who were welcoming and helpful, also ran tours and food evenings which were a great way to meet people."
"We stayed in a double private room. The room is spacious for 2 people, the en-suite bathroom is modern, with hot and cold water, all toiletries (including toilet paper upon request) were provided and the AC unit was powerful and silent. 
The location is not exactly in the main tourist area BUT they are 5 min walk to the metro and from there you can go anywhere in the city. We didn’t join but they also provide tours to the main attractions of old Delhi for a good price."
The socializing atmosphere
"The hostel is only a couple minutes walking from the metro which is good because I stayed here only one night just to fly out of Delhi (I stayed in a different hostel when I previously spent a few days in Delhi and wish I had chosen Joey’s then). To get to the airport you have to change trains twice but it is very easy and so cheap! The hostel seemed very social and appeared to have events on every night. Beds comfy with curtains, and the girls bathroom on the first floor had 3 toilets and 3 showers, so plenty of space. Staff were very friendly, too. I would definitely stay again."
Group tours are really good

We enjoyed spending time in the common dining and living areas at the start or end of a busy day, enjoying the calm, cool atmosphere of the whole place.
Breakfast was included and was served by attentive staff. We didn't take advantage of the opportunity for an evening meal but it was good to have this as an option.
The staff stayed up very late to let us in when our flight was delayed, which we appreciated."

Everything was good except the wet floor. Floor was wet all the time.
" · Room servis not good, did not make up bed and clean room regularly"
"Rooms are clean, Bathroom is very clean. Reception staff is very good. Only problem is that it doesn't have fooding facility but still can consider this Hotel. I really liked it. It's very nice and comfortable. I would give it 4 Star out of 5."
All the staffs are quite ok. Front desk staff was cooperative.

food
Good location in an upmarket area for a reasonable price.
"Room size was very good, Served very good breakfast.  Location was posh."
"locates in Sundar Nagar, high class property quarter in New Delhi. Also 10 min by car to Nizamutdin railway station (trains to Agra) and Gamajun Mausoleum. Fine bakery and restaurant 3 min walk. You can also reach India Gate by foot through administrative quarter which is clean."
"Rooms were good, helpful staff, location was the the main plus point for us."
location - home type -
It is a beautiful property in a well established residential area. Very well maintained and quiet. This is home away from home. I thank Mr. Abdul and his team for making my stay very comfortable.
everything was very nice.  right from the check in process to the room it was very good. the bathroom however could have been of a more decent size. there was very less water coming through the taps. location was mind blowing
really spacious room. had lots of areas to roam. near posh area of gk1 and mblock market. staff was extremely helpful and friendly. highly recommended.
"Staff , especially Abdul and his team and food was homely ."
"Right from the onset, My wife and I fell in love with the place. Afzal, hope I got the name right was a gem. He welcomed us with a heart warming smile. After finishing the formalities of the check-in we were shown our room and we were blown away. We have been to quite a few B&Bs but this was different. The place was tastefully done up with a lovely lounge area on the ground floor and the first floor with a balcony full of lovely plants. Not to forget the superb collection of books.
After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.
We extended our stay by a few hours and when I was not able to get a taxi to go to the airport, Afzal arranged it in a jiffy.
Thank you Team The Neem for this little hidden gem."
"Excellent location in a quiet and gated neighbourhood, shops and restaurants a couple of minutes walk away.
The staff is really excellent! Kind and very helpful.
The room is spacious and decently equipped.
Highly recommended!"
"Clean rooms ,Location and The service is amazing.
Special thanks to the boys Ajay and Afzal who wer available 24/7 to help."
"very clean, exactly as pictured. No complaints whatsoever regarding comfort of room. free drinking water, mini fridge in room, the room was really sizeable. great for two people."
Everything about this place is near on faultless. Abdul the manager is available and willing to provide a 5* service around the clock. The place and room is super clean and fresh and the building holds a positive energy in itself. If you choose to have dinner you will not be disappointed. Fresh and delicious dishes were provided. I felt safe and like I was home away from home. Will definitely be returning when I visit Delhi again.
"Home away from home. Great location in a quietish sububarb but accessible to travel to places of interest. Great customer service from start to end. Regular communication once booking was made; on arrival staff were warm, friendly, accessible and helpful. Establishment felt safe and was clean, comfortable with a relaxing environment. A common room was a great alternative if you did not want to be restricted to your room."
"Very friendly staff. They speak Bengali and very helpful. Rooms are wide enough and toilet is clean and specious. A bit hard to find it but let me guide you. Just take the ally beside Axis bank ATM from main bazar road and keep going. Take the right turn in Y junction. When you are out of the ally, there is your hotel. Onnce you get to the property once it is easy to find. The ally is not clean though. But the hotel is nice."
Good price in the center.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Raj Mahal Inn, I stayed previously and would definitely return if visiting Delhi. The Staff are all very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is within minutes of the main bazaar but set back from the busy streets. I used their airport pickup service which was very reliable. A home from home."

"The location is not in the main road but this is just a minute walk from the main road hence the rent is almost half. However, the staff took care of transferring our luggage. And the location is not middle of no where, there are other hotels and restaurants. The only thing is the hotel doesnot have 24x7 hot water. They turn the boiler on twice. However, on request, they turn it on as well. The hotel is safe for family."
Very bad service

The location is good and the place is a great value for money. Their food service is also good and quick. Do try their omelet and paranthas.
this hotel is located near to Airport. Once you reach to hotel no need to worry for anything. All staff are very helpful and supportive. Always ready to help you with their smiley face. Room was very much clean. Good variety of food. With good reception staff. Specially housekeeping team who takes care of my small small things. Highly recommend.
Location convenient for igia t3 Airport
"loved the location, hotel was nice and clean"
The location of the hotel and staff behavior
"The hotel is cosy for travellers on a business trip as the property is close to the airport, but it is a little far from the tourist destinations and metro stations. The room I stayed in did not have any windows. The one with the window had its view blocked by the next building, and I did not like the toilet. So I opted for a windowless room. The room was clean. The washrooms are good. The towel was not very white, but you may live with it. Food is expensive, though. All short of cheaper food ((veg/non-veg) and restaurants are available just opposite and further down the road."
Breakfast was excellent.
"Good place to have a night close to the Delhi airport.
Good pricing"
Cleanliness
The room was very large and I liked how it was about 15 minutes to the airport since I needed to take a flight the next day.  I also received very friendly service from the staff.  The breakfast was also pretty good.
Nearest to Airport and accessible to nearby Metro and malls..hotel Staff are the most helpful people.
Lovely ambience. Great courteous staff and great service. Loved the breakfast was great and served with a smile. Over all a great experience.

The pricing and location were good for my work
The hotel was fantastic. It exceeded my expectations. The price was incredible. There were several excellent restaurants within walking distance. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.
"It's a nice, quiet neighbourhood that is simultaneously close to two decently connected metro stations. The staff were knowledgeable and obliging. Bringing breakfast to the room is a nice touch."
The staff- nothing was too much trouble.
The place is the same as the pictures are put up! Decent facilities available. Quaint little place - situated in a residential area so that works. At a stones throw there are a bunch of restaurants you can eat at.
Food is not too good but we can order food from outside. Staff behaviour is good.
Locality was good staff was good
Hospitality
Good  comfortable maple room but lacks charging point around bed. Good balcony. Bathroom needs more maintenance
"Lift, bathroom space equal in oak and maple, and somehow reasonable price to stay so far"
So far doing good cleaning of room. Providing small standard room with justifiable rate. However one of reception new staff highly unsatisfied with price. But this is none of the business for residing guest.
In a busy road with lots of smaller hotels and food places. Exactly what we wanted. We used the hotels tour office which was well priced and very efficient. Thank you Najrul for organizing
Everything was good
The staff was really kind and let us to put our bags in the hotel after checking out and the location of the place was very good and close to railway station and attractions.

 · They charged extra money.
Located near major station
"Location, staff and price is fair"
The only thing I liked was Booking.com excellent service to pay later after confirmation of the stay on the app.
Nothing..worst experience ever
No TV  NO DIM LIGHT IN BEDROOM LOCATION OK
" · No service 
Even water is not provided in room"

"We booked this place for the day, in order to keep the luggage available between a night train and a flight at night and take a shower. This is not too far from the metro yellow line that goes to the airport : just need to walk 10-15 min though the New Delhi station.
When we arrived early in the morning, no room was yet available so we were sent to another hotel nearby for a slightly higher fee.
Correct and basic hotel in the middle of narrow streets with not much comfort."
El hotel estaba cerrado cuando llegamos. Llamé por teléfono y me dijeron que no estaba abierto hasta el 13 de septiembre. Tendrían que quitar el hotel hasta esa fecha. Me parece que es una estafa

food
Good location in an upmarket area for a reasonable price.
"Room size was very good, Served very good breakfast.  Location was posh."
"locates in Sundar Nagar, high class property quarter in New Delhi. Also 10 min by car to Nizamutdin railway station (trains to Agra) and Gamajun Mausoleum. Fine bakery and restaurant 3 min walk. You can also reach India Gate by foot through administrative quarter which is clean."
"Rooms were good, helpful staff, location was the the main plus point for us."
location - home type -
It is a beautiful property in a well established residential area. Very well maintained and quiet. This is home away from home. I thank Mr. Abdul and his team for making my stay very comfortable.
everything was very nice.  right from the check in process to the room it was very good. the bathroom however could have been of a more decent size. there was very less water coming through the taps. location was mind blowing
really spacious room. had lots of areas to roam. near posh area of gk1 and mblock market. staff was extremely helpful and friendly. highly recommended.
"Staff , especially Abdul and his team and food was homely ."
"Right from the onset, My wife and I fell in love with the place. Afzal, hope I got the name right was a gem. He welcomed us with a heart warming smile. After finishing the formalities of the check-in we were shown our room and we were blown away. We have been to quite a few B&Bs but this was different. The place was tastefully done up with a lovely lounge area on the ground floor and the first floor with a balcony full of lovely plants. Not to forget the superb collection of books.
After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.
We extended our stay by a few hours and when I was not able to get a taxi to go to the airport, Afzal arranged it in a jiffy.
Thank you Team The Neem for this little hidden gem."
"Excellent location in a quiet and gated neighbourhood, shops and restaurants a couple of minutes walk away.
The staff is really excellent! Kind and very helpful.
The room is spacious and decently equipped.
Highly recommended!"
"Clean rooms ,Location and The service is amazing.
Special thanks to the boys Ajay and Afzal who wer available 24/7 to help."
"very clean, exactly as pictured. No complaints whatsoever regarding comfort of room. free drinking water, mini fridge in room, the room was really sizeable. great for two people."
Everything about this place is near on faultless. Abdul the manager is available and willing to provide a 5* service around the clock. The place and room is super clean and fresh and the building holds a positive energy in itself. If you choose to have dinner you will not be disappointed. Fresh and delicious dishes were provided. I felt safe and like I was home away from home. Will definitely be returning when I visit Delhi again.
"Home away from home. Great location in a quietish sububarb but accessible to travel to places of interest. Great customer service from start to end. Regular communication once booking was made; on arrival staff were warm, friendly, accessible and helpful. Establishment felt safe and was clean, comfortable with a relaxing environment. A common room was a great alternative if you did not want to be restricted to your room."
"Location is a Million bucks, Large rooms, 
Though the lift didnt work, they carried my bags up 
they were apologetic over the electricity short circuit but got it fixed the next morning and changed my room."
"I was cheated.  Someone called on behalf of skyinn and I ended up in horrible guest house 
This is tarnishing your reputation.  Take care immediately"
"this place is very clean and the staff is very nice and helpful!! Small but comfortable common areas. The bathrooms were modern and clean, The rooms are not very big, but they are comfortable and clean."
"I absolutely loved my dormitory room! The cozy space provided a perfect atmosphere for relaxation. The room was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities, including a comfortable bed and ample storage"
Best service one can find for the price! The establishment features a welcoming common area with a kitchen and a cook available from 09:00 am till 11:00 pm.
"Very friendly staff. They speak Bengali and very helpful. Rooms are wide enough and toilet is clean and specious. A bit hard to find it but let me guide you. Just take the ally beside Axis bank ATM from main bazar road and keep going. Take the right turn in Y junction. When you are out of the ally, there is your hotel. Onnce you get to the property once it is easy to find. The ally is not clean though. But the hotel is nice."
Good price in the center.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Raj Mahal Inn, I stayed previously and would definitely return if visiting Delhi. The Staff are all very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is within minutes of the main bazaar but set back from the busy streets. I used their airport pickup service which was very reliable. A home from home."

this hotel is located near to Airport. Once you reach to hotel no need to worry for anything. All staff are very helpful and supportive. Always ready to help you with their smiley face. Room was very much clean. Good variety of food. With good reception staff. Specially housekeeping team who takes care of my small small things. Highly recommend.
Location convenient for igia t3 Airport
"loved the location, hotel was nice and clean"
The location of the hotel and staff behavior
"The hotel is cosy for travellers on a business trip as the property is close to the airport, but it is a little far from the tourist destinations and metro stations. The room I stayed in did not have any windows. The one with the window had its view blocked by the next building, and I did not like the toilet. So I opted for a windowless room. The room was clean. The washrooms are good. The towel was not very white, but you may live with it. Food is expensive, though. All short of cheaper food ((veg/non-veg) and restaurants are available just opposite and further down the road."
Breakfast was excellent.
"Good place to have a night close to the Delhi airport.
Good pricing"
Cleanliness
The room was very large and I liked how it was about 15 minutes to the airport since I needed to take a flight the next day.  I also received very friendly service from the staff.  The breakfast was also pretty good.
Nearest to Airport and accessible to nearby Metro and malls..hotel Staff are the most helpful people.
"Exceed my expectations, value for money, good location near metro station"
Our stay was comfortable and room service is also good.
Near airport . Very clean and comfortable room.
It’s Overall Very Good Experience

Excellent in every aspect. Best place to stay in Delhi.
The service was absolutely amazing.
overall a good
The hotel was fantastic. It exceeded my expectations. The price was incredible. There were several excellent restaurants within walking distance. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.
"It's a nice, quiet neighbourhood that is simultaneously close to two decently connected metro stations. The staff were knowledgeable and obliging. Bringing breakfast to the room is a nice touch."
The staff- nothing was too much trouble.
The place is the same as the pictures are put up! Decent facilities available. Quaint little place - situated in a residential area so that works. At a stones throw there are a bunch of restaurants you can eat at.
Food is not too good but we can order food from outside. Staff behaviour is good.
Locality was good staff was good
Hospitality
Good  comfortable maple room but lacks charging point around bed. Good balcony. Bathroom needs more maintenance
"Lift, bathroom space equal in oak and maple, and somehow reasonable price to stay so far"
So far doing good cleaning of room. Providing small standard room with justifiable rate. However one of reception new staff highly unsatisfied with price. But this is none of the business for residing guest.
In a busy road with lots of smaller hotels and food places. Exactly what we wanted. We used the hotels tour office which was well priced and very efficient. Thank you Najrul for organizing
Everything was good
The staff was really kind and let us to put our bags in the hotel after checking out and the location of the place was very good and close to railway station and attractions.

"he hotel was absolutely stunning, with its exquisite interior design that transformed each room into a unique and captivating world. The balcony attached to our room was nothing short of magnificent. Overall, it was a great stay!"
"Great stay and staffs are very cooperative and rooms are good and spacious every amenities are already kept in room and A/C cooling was also very good. Whenever we ask for anything we need they bring that within few minutes, good housekeeping and receptionists.."

The location is good and the place is a great value for money. Their food service is also good and quick. Do try their omelet and paranthas.
this hotel is located near to Airport. Once you reach to hotel no need to worry for anything. All staff are very helpful and supportive. Always ready to help you with their smiley face. Room was very much clean. Good variety of food. With good reception staff. Specially housekeeping team who takes care of my small small things. Highly recommend.
Location convenient for igia t3 Airport
"loved the location, hotel was nice and clean"
The location of the hotel and staff behavior
"The hotel is cosy for travellers on a business trip as the property is close to the airport, but it is a little far from the tourist destinations and metro stations. The room I stayed in did not have any windows. The one with the window had its view blocked by the next building, and I did not like the toilet. So I opted for a windowless room. The room was clean. The washrooms are good. The towel was not very white, but you may live with it. Food is expensive, though. All short of cheaper food ((veg/non-veg) and restaurants are available just opposite and further down the road."
Breakfast was excellent.
"Good place to have a night close to the Delhi airport.
Good pricing"
Cleanliness
The room was very large and I liked how it was about 15 minutes to the airport since I needed to take a flight the next day.  I also received very friendly service from the staff.  The breakfast was also pretty good.
Nearest to Airport and accessible to nearby Metro and malls..hotel Staff are the most helpful people.
Lovely ambience. Great courteous staff and great service. Loved the breakfast was great and served with a smile. Over all a great experience.
Hospitality was amazing.  Room was very spacious   and food was superb I will definitely come again. Whole family enjoyed a lot. area was also nice.

Very bad service 😤😤😤😤
The pricing and location were good for my work
The hotel was fantastic. It exceeded my expectations. The price was incredible. There were several excellent restaurants within walking distance. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.
"It's a nice, quiet neighbourhood that is simultaneously close to two decently connected metro stations. The staff were knowledgeable and obliging. Bringing breakfast to the room is a nice touch."
The staff- nothing was too much trouble.
The place is the same as the pictures are put up! Decent facilities available. Quaint little place - situated in a residential area so that works. At a stones throw there are a bunch of restaurants you can eat at.
Food is not too good but we can order food from outside. Staff behaviour is good.
Locality was good staff was good
Hospitality
Good  comfortable maple room but lacks charging point around bed. Good balcony. Bathroom needs more maintenance
"Lift, bathroom space equal in oak and maple, and somehow reasonable price to stay so far"
So far doing good cleaning of room. Providing small standard room with justifiable rate. However one of reception new staff highly unsatisfied with price. But this is none of the business for residing guest.
In a busy road with lots of smaller hotels and food places. Exactly what we wanted. We used the hotels tour office which was well priced and very efficient. Thank you Najrul for organizing
Everything was good
The staff was really kind and let us to put our bags in the hotel after checking out and the location of the place was very good and close to railway station and attractions.

"Staff has been extremely helpful and friendly. They also kept how luggage for free for 2 weeks while we were away from Delhi between 2 stays. Each room has a fridge that works... Located as close as possible of bus starting for overnight travel to Bir, Kangra, etc."
The room was clean and the hotel has an excellent restaurant serving delicious Asian dishes for those who are not fans of Indian cuisine.
"Superb hotel with a lovely restaurant. Team are very friendly and accommodating. Rooms are impeccably clean, comfortable and provide many amenities. I paid extra for a beautiful view of the Yamuna River, which I feel was worth it!
The hotel is located down an alleyway in Majnu Ka Tila, and the location feels quiet and safe at all times of the day.
Well-established in Majnu Ka Tila - would definitely stay here again."
The ladies at the drsk were very helpful and friendly. Everything fine! The location was nice.
Didn’t order breakfast
Friendly and helpful staff. Provided all the services requested. Easy to go down and eat in the restaurant or just order food in the room and chill and eat. Very accommodating with my last minute schedule change as I had to rush to the airport earlier than planned due to my plane being cancelled. They booked me a taxi late at night and also stored an empty suitcase I couldn't take with me so some family member could pick it up later.
"Quiet, friendly, clean!"

"Really great place to stay. Super clean and very kind staff. Located in ""Tibet Town"" They helped me exchange money at a very good rate, and also booked a bus for me with an escort to make sure I got on the right bus. The restaurant inside is also very good. Highly recommended. Not recommended to arrive alone at night."

"You enter the hotel and you are in a different world. It's absolutely serene inside the hotel. Very Japanese feeling as it caters to Japanese clients.
The food is one of the best we have had. There is little option of Indian food but still great food.
The rooms are lovely (studio rooms) with microwave    facility. You can cook your own maggi or heat up a nice dish.
The restaurant serves authentic Japanese and sushi. Just loved it. Not to heavy on the pocket but not to light either."

Location
" · We booked for this hotel on the basis of good reviews however when we checked in, the story was the other way around. 
First, I don't  like when  staff went inside room without our knowledge, after we checked in and we decided to keep our stuffs inside. We knew upon arrival that there was no toiletries and towels(they should get rooms ready before customers will enter) but when we came back after strolling outside, we found out that someone entered and put inside bathroom. If ever that they needed to add fe things, they should ask permission first if it was okay to enter rooms or not.
Second,our package includes meal for  breakfast but on first day of our stay, we saw hair intact in aloo parantha. When we show it to the room delivery guy, he told that it was by mistake that hair was also added in the recipe.
Third, on second day of our stay, next room door was watching movie in full volume like they were in disco. The facility is not sound proof and we can hear them enjoying around 12pm.
 Fourth, on third day of stay,that was early morning, someone tried to open our door aggressively. We requested to check cctv to know who is acting like that which clearly violated our privacy. Reception staff apologised and told that  this will not happen again. Those people occupying next room will go next day.
I attached picture of aloo parantha with hair and the bathroom glass panes which can give someone in balcony a good peek inside bathroom."
"The location was only a short ride from the city centre, and a short walk to local markets. The room was clean and equipped with more than what we needed. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, providing information, allowed us to store our bags on-site after we had checked out and helped us to organise transport to the bus station."

The staff booked a taxi for me very early morning.
Early Check In Charged
 · The area around the property is too dirty and congested
The staff was good.....
The hotel was closed hence didn't stay there. I repeatedly called the number that was provided but it was switched off
"Staff was friendly and rather helpful, they answered the WhatsApp quickly, they book me the taxi to the airport, they changed the room according to my request.
Another big plus that it’s not far from the airport, location is just 1 metro station away from Indira Gandhi International Airport."
The property doesn’t exist anymore
"The hotel was closed. It did not.have a license according to the taxi driver . I arrived to Delhi at 3 am. I took a taxi which drive me to a really scary area: no walkside, mud everywhere, shaby buildings, dangerous looking. There was a little banner with the name of the hotel, but al lights off and nobody there. Summaring, It is a scam."
" · First of all, This is a fraudulent booking. When I booked the hotel, it had another name; when I booked my stay after some days, it changed the word, and now it has another name. When I arrived at the airport and called the given phone number, I was told to call another. I called that number no one answered the call. When I called the old number, the person did not pick up. It is a fraudulent and very doubtful business. I searched the property in and around Aerocity for the next 4 hrs but could not locate the place. My driver told me there is a lot of fraud in Delhi, where one hotel is run under different names. They have one word when booking the hotel and another when you start looking for the place. My booking was a waste and money down the drain. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM BOOKING UNKNOWN BUSINESS HOTELS IN DELHI. This city is full of cheats and frauds. They predate on innocent customers and give bad names to other business owners. 
Please book with reputable hotels, even if they are a little expensive."
Staff giving money for any work

The hotel was too bad and the staff was so arrogant... first they denied my Booking on booking price and asked for more money at that time...so I ask them show me room first..when I seen the room it was so dirty,,messy, towel is in too bad condition..smell was there....and staff was so arrogant..so i leave from that property....do not book your hotel from booking .com..."
The staff was very cooperative and forthcoming in their approach. They were very cordial and made our stay wonderful.

Manager Ashwani is good 👍 than all is well
The owner was very thoughtful and it felt like a home away from home. Will certainly recommend the place and go back.
"the owner is a very educated and guest oriented manager, who was flexible and of great help at any time. The facilities are great, as well as the breakfast"
The host is really sweet and kind. The rooms were clean. I would recommend people to stay here
The Hospitality
The staff was incredibly kind and helpful! The food was great and they will even make you dinner and arrange rides for you for extra fees. The hotel is within walking distance of Saket metro which is very helpful. The A/C worked great (very important in June) and the area is very quiet which I prefer. The bathroom was very nice and the internet was excellent!
"I had heard of Ashwani's legendary qualities as an excellent host since I was in Brazil, and could confirm that the moment I met him. He promptly arranged my bedroom for me earlier than planned since I was exhausted after a 27-hour flight. He was so kind and gave me maps and lots of information about how to get to famous places, which places to avoid and which ones to visit. My stay in Delhi was a total success because of him. As for the B&B, I was in an excellent room with clean, wide and cozy facilities. The place is in a safe, residential area in south Delhi. I went out perfectly safe to take a walk at 3:30 in the morning and everything was fine. I'll surely be back. Best regards from a very satisfied Brazilian guest."
"Perfect place to stay on our first trip to Delhi.  The owner was incredibly helpful in arranging a car for sightseeing and spent time with us in lovely conversation.  The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. Very welcoming.  Safe neighborhood, leafy and walkable."
"This is a hotel where I will definitely stay again and again when I come to Delhi. I had read all the positive reviews on booking.com, but the reality exceeded all my expectations. Everything is very clean, the staff is absolutely friendly and helpful, the breakfast couldn't be better, the shower works perfectly, also all sockets are in best condition. When I was in the room, I really didn't hear any of the noise that is so typical for Delhi. I only heard the birds singing and felt like I was in a resort somewhere in the jungle. For this price, you get absolutely high quality and a very high standard here. There is nothing they could do better."
"Was there only for a few hours, beds were comfortable, nice shower,  good collection of books and easy Hassel free entry and exit"
Very nice although the cost is a little cheap.

nothing i liked about this property worst experience ever in my booking history.
What ever is shown on the picture and the name of the hotel is different . Try searching hotel somewhere else . Rooms are too small and bedsheets are dirty . We tried calling hotel manager 16 times they didn’t recived the call . Original name of hotel is roma delux other wise you won’t get the location
"Very clean floors.
Staff are very polite."
"Staffs are cordial ,  A/c rooms are adjacent to Reception, which is little bit uncomfort , while you open the door outside person can see the entire room, (may be due to space constrain), that is the main draw back and no good eatieries are near by this hotel, Nizamuddin  rly. Station is vry near (:hardly 1 KM)."
 · Yesterday at midnight  1:30 AM somebody knock the door two to three times and telling like somebody came for you. Is it the way you need to  be with traveller and I was travelled alone  and new to place how come somebody came for me at new place that to at midnight 1:30AM. And  also you call 2 times at that time to telephone land line number. It was an strange thing that doesn't accepted
"Guys these people are cheaters and fraudster.. Never ever believe them..
They will loot you and give troubles unnecessary.."
"The location is quite OK, 2km from the H Nizamuddin station."
I had a best experience
Staff was very cooperative
Amazing room and cleanness.
Very humble and supportive staff
Nice experience.. all is good
I didn't like a single thing about your service!

Die Lage des Hostels ist sehr zentral. Eine Metro Station ist auch in der Nähe. Die Terrasse ist auch super.
"The host was really great. Was very helpful and have good concern for the guests. Easily reachable and always ready to help the guests.

But I could say it is really value for money."

This is one of the Best Hostel in Delhi.
Stayed in Grace hotel for my recent trip to Delhi. Was searching for a hotel near to Airport as I wanted to travel to Jaipur next day. I found this hotel on booking.com after seeing the price & location which was like convenient for me. Took a taxi & drive to Hotel in just 10 mins. Hotel was really quite good. Right from reception to service everything was fine. Room was spacious & had all the amenities. All together a nice stay & would recommend to everyone who is looking for a hotel near to Airport..

"Didn't take breakfast, location not ideal"
"Room was clean, large beds no issues. Most staff were quite friendly. Guys at the reception was helpful in guiding me about the nearby areas and the auto / taxi pricing so I don't get ripped off by the drivers. Not much noise was heard inside the room from outside areas. Sleep was pleasant. I had an early morning check out to catch the 6am train, the staff helped with arranging the auto from the main road which was really good. Thank you :)"
"Very nice hotel, staff very helpful and knowledgeable. At the hotel you can make reservations for trains, exchange currency, order a taxi, rickshaw."
"Extremely comfortable beds and a quiet room. We slept very well.  Close enough to New Delhi station and the airport metro to make it a very good choice for transit. 
The room and bathroom were large and very clean with everything we needed and even a fridge that we didn't. 
The service was very good from start to finish and a special mention goes to the man who carried our heavy bags to get a Rickshaw.
And all this for a very good price. It is probably the best hotel we stayed in over five months of travelling in India and Sri Lanka. 
Thanks team Su Shree!"

"Room was good size and beds were provided as shown in pictures, but pillows were so old that little knots were formed in it, the floor near to electrical kettle was not cleaned properly there were hair form previous guest everywhere, windows were full of dust and dirt.

"It was a nice and pleasant stay. We were a group of four  in need of peace, privacy, serenity and a place to relax and rejuvenate. This quadruple room was a perfect match for this. 
The staff were kind and made sumptuous breakfast for us."
"We booked a family room with 4 people. The room was very clean and large. The owner is very flexible with the timing of breakfast.
The hotel is opposite a park, so, there is hardly any noise  coming from Delhi. It is a great place to escape from the chaos in Delhi."
"First of all I did not stay at C6 but C9 9415, fortunately I had a taxi from the Homestay to pick me from the railway station. Had I took an ordinary taxi I would have struggled to reach the home stay. The taxi driver Angad was good he was polite and took me straight to C9 9415. The caretaker Amit was very efficient he arranged all my transportation and drop at airport. Gave me what I wanted for breakfast tomato and Chat Masala. Room is relatively clean and so in the bath room and toilet. AC worked well.The room although do not have windows but very quiet, very comfortable firm bed. There are healthy plants at the entrance and the small court yard had a very tall mature tree."
"The location is fabulous.
The Breakfast was great.
Good and supportive staff
Big room which is suitable for 6 persons."
The staff were super friendly and helpful. The hotel is a fair price for the quality of hotel. I was working in a very expensive hotel and was happy to come away to this small and friendly hotel at night. I was travelling with stomach problems so was eating very plain food. However the chicken curry smells coming up from the kitchen were great
homely
"Excellent food, great location, park just next to it, cook and manager were very courteous and prepared awesome food. Very safe locality. Room size was fine, bed was comfortable."
"Lovely location. 
Chander ji was very helpful and made lovely tea."
"Location near to airport, within secured housing society - much better option than nearby Mahipalpur cluster filled with below average hotels. Friendly staff."
Staff was excellent
"Dirty bedsheets/mosquitoes everywhere.
drunk people come with call girls and all night sounds coming"

We stayed for one night only in this hotel. They serve some decent food in their restaurant but breakfast is a bit too pricey for what you get. Rooms are big and comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay there
Nice location- Its in main market. Services are wonderful. Staff really nice.

Most of them who come for the visa interview choose this hotel for their stay. The food and restaurant services were good and the food taste was awesome. The staff members are very good at the service.
Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel 👍"

My partner is incredibly happy! 
First of all for the birthday cake present, it’s so sweet.
Second is an assistance with a small injury and calling a doctor at midnight for a consultation with providing some basic medical advice.
Much appreciate it.
All those things are making only the best memories from the hotel in New Delhi."
Nice Place
I liked the view from my 9 th floor balcony.. The Chinese food was excellent. The breakfast was good had it been on the house it would have been great
very centrally located. good place.
"Great food. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel, and we really liked the spread and taste of the food. Staff could have been more cheering, but never the less, we enjoyed the ambience there. It is at a prime location and the view from our room was amazing, with a glimpse of panoramic lotus temple sight at the horizon. Room was comfortable and matched our expectations."
The breakfast and dinner menus were good. We enjoyed the food and the hospitality.
The hotel is nice and depending when you book it is good value for money.

"The best part of the property is location, it’s so fresh, green and serene. No objection on unmarried couple staying and spending quality time there, I don’t know though maybe loud music and party seen can be a bit of problem though if you’re coming for this purpose since it’s a locality and locals may get offend but then again the management and staff ( Tejendra) he will and can take a good care."
The location was good. Easy to reach.
"location is good, it was not family room with balcony.
on enquiry hotel staff said they don't have any room with balcony.  i booked family room with balcony but it was simple standard double room. & we had to ask for extra bed to accommodate 3 adults."

Helpful staff and good facilities. absolutely worth the prize

Much appreciate it.
All those things are making only the best memories from the hotel in New Delhi."

very centrally located. good place.
"Great food. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel, and we really liked the spread and taste of the food. Staff could have been more cheering, but never the less, we enjoyed the ambience there. It is at a prime location and the view from our room was amazing, with a glimpse of panoramic lotus temple sight at the horizon. Room was comfortable and matched our expectations."
The breakfast and dinner menus were good. We enjoyed the food and the hospitality.
The hotel is nice and depending when you book it is good value for money.

With dedicated service staff like Aayush, Jatin, Gopal and Komal who are always ready to go extra mile to help the guest get the best experience of the stay and the good quality food items there. The duty managers and the guest service staff members were a pleasure to talk to and I appreciate that they always provided the best value possible ( without asking) for all the prices we paid for different services. Shreya helped us at every level to resolved our requests with a pleasant experience. The dedication of the transportation staff to service the client with the attitude to keep clients needs ahead of their own personal difficulties was beyond words. Awesome experience of the hospitality industry service excellence."

"The place we always stay when visiting Delhi! Clean comfortable rooms. Friendly and helpful staff and a lovely owner who is happy to sit and chat and make you feel at home. The hotel is quiet and walking distance to food and drink options, as well as metro. Have stayed here a couple of times."
Great owner. Invited us to a drink.
The staff was kind and extremely helpful.  The bed was comfortable and it was off the main roads.
The rooms were clean and old but maintained. No plug near bed for charging
"If you are wondering about where to stay in Dehli, then we would recommend this area and hotel! We were only staying one night prior to a flight but will definitely come back if we return to Dehli in the future :) The hotel is very clean and comfortable and located in a nice part of Dehli with plenty of food and drink options nearby (or in the hotel itself although we didnt try). The staff are very helpful and we were very happy with our stay :)"
"The hotel is good for families. As of today they do not have a restaurant. But, as discussed with the manager there, they are planning to open a new kitchen for themselves. Either way, they served us breakfast and dinner on pre-order basis. The rooms were neat and really comfortable. They changed our room on request and no hassle in that. The staff was very polite and approachable."
Location and Staff
"This is the only property my family could find that was true to their word. Wood Castle was CLEAN, the beds sooo comfortable (especially the pillows) and the bathrooms were exceptional. Compared to every other property we stayed booked in India or researched, this was the only one that matched their images and was actually above a liveable standard of cleanliness. My family booked two different rooms and the standards delivered were consistent. The staff were super accommodating too!"
"This is our home in India. Already here for the second time - first time before pandemics, but nothing changed since then.
- spotless clean
- exceptionally nice hosts, always helpful, even at 2 am
- very good quite location - in a residential area - absolutely safe
- comfortable beds 
- complimentary water 
Everyhting is just perfect, best value for the money from all the accommodations we tried in Delhi."

The location was fantastic and even though it is based on a main road the hotel is set back and very quiet.  Within walking distance to the subway.  Rooms beautiful with everything you could possibly need.  Breakfast too was sensational - so many choices and everything a delight.  Evening meal in the restaurant excellent quality and taste.  Swimming pool a dream to return to after a day out sightseeing.  There is nothing not to like here.
"Everything was great - nice helpful staff, very large clean room, good facilities. Breakfast was pretty decent, the restaurant menu and quality of cooking were quite good. Overall, I can recommend the hotel."
"Clean, tidy inside and out, staff were excellent and could not do enough for the customer, will return."
"Amazing hotel colonial style full of glamour in Delhi .
Great breakfast and great staff specially housekeeper John pakhumate and amazing hotel lobby staff"
Everything went well. From check-in to checkout. It was a comfortable experience. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. The staff at the Maidens Hotel are some of the friendliest and most attentive I have ever encountered. They are always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you have a comfortable stay. The food was deliciously prepared.
"Charming old colonial hotel with beautiful rooms, delicious breakfast and the most amazing staff that would go over and beyond with whatever help or assistance was needed."
I have previously stayed at the Maidens on three other occasions.  This visit did not dissapoint. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay the best experience. From the minute you walk through the door till you depart you are treated like family .
"Amazing rooms and fantastic service. All staff couldnt do enough for you. They went above and beyond decorating my mums room with petals and balloons for a birthday suprise and even provided birthday cake whilst we were at dinner. The pool is beautiful and very relaxing, especially with a beautiful peacock roaming around. Would 100% reccomend and definitely come back again."
Only the location is convenient
Manager as very bad

A very comfortable and peaceful oasis within New Delhi
Great property
"A great place, fully corresponds to the description, ideal for families and individual travelers.
The house is located in a quiet and peaceful place. There are a lot of flowers and greenery on the territory
Delicious breakfast, fresh fruit every morning.
Separately, I would like to express my gratitude to Amrita and the hotel staff, if there are any difficulties, they immediately help"
"This was truly an oasis for us in Delhi.  It is a beautiful, peaceful property with lots of flowers and greenery.  We felt relieved to return here each night after being out on the busy streets of Delhi and Saket during the day.  Amrita, the owner, was wonderful.  She helped us coordinate our activities each day, and her cook prepared delicious dinners for us at night.  I will definitely stay here again if I return to Delhi."
Except for the location this is really creates a home atmosphere . Can stay
"The room was spacious, well-decorated and neat&clean. Our stay was very comfortable. The breakfast and the service were good as well."
We were allowed to leave our luggage there after checkout to pick it up later - very nice people
"Good breakfast
Good location 
Recommended"
"A beautiful farm house style stay. Hospitality was at its best. Big cheers to the energetic Amrita who is a great host. The staff were also very down to earth. 
I enjoyed a lovely home dinner on my first day."
"Our host, Amrita was very helpful and friendly. She helped us with directions and check-in even though it was as late as 1am.
We had a tasty cooked breakfast in the morning and all the staff were very polite and kind. They accommodated our extra requests, such as drying our clothes on the line outside and refilling water bottles.
Amrita also gave us plenty of good suggestions about places to see and restaurants.
It was very easy to pay as well with our cards and we didn't need to fetch cash."
"An outstanding experience at this hotel! No need for further reviews, everything has been said and appreciated. I want to emphasize how attentive and friendly the staff is. All services were top-notch - excellent service, reliable internet, impeccable cleanliness in both the rooms and bathrooms.
The presence of a separate kitchen and lounge on each floor was particularly delightful, providing additional comfort. It allows for pleasant moments and interaction with other guests.
I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the perfect place to stay. You will definitely not regret your choice!"
Very good

Hotel was very good.
Staff behaviour

Good for night stay.
I didn't have breakfast.
 · when reached the property I was asked to move to another hotel rather than the hotel I booked. staff are arrogant . after long deliberation on my insistence they allowed to remain in Arrotech. very bad experience. to check in it took more than an hour.

"The best hotel I’ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in. High quality rooms (there was even a tv by the shower), and high quality service. Also, they are one of few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.
Great experience
With the welcome drink and snacks provided by the hotel staff staff behaviour is to good."
location was good…It was near to Metro station.
"Location was quite good.
We had not taken breakfast due to fasting therefore unable to share the feedback on that."
Nuce
" · Unhygienic,card machine not working,towel facilities not available....unhygienic environment"
Only location. Hotel was booked primarily for the easy road and metro train access to the exam centre at Mundka (where my wife was appearing). Food by their inhouse kitchen deserves some marks of praise.
never ever go here!!
Only thing good about this hotel is that it's right next to the metro station.
Nothing.
"Every thing especially the food -food was excellent and staff very caring Very friendly staff, always ready to help and offer suggestions.

Staff behaviour

Location
 · Staff has supportive nature. I had checked in 4hrs early.
 · Does bookings dot com do any quality check of these hotels? The facilities provided are not worth for what they are charging. The bed sheet and pillows were dirty with hairs. Room was having a very bad smell. There were rats inside the room at night. Plug points are bad and not working. Hygiene is something they don’t know. Food we’re average. I have no clue how I managed to stay awake the whole night because I couldn’t sleep with rats running everywhere. Foul smell coming out from AC made the whole room a miserable place.

Even when we asked to change the pillow covers they didn't have clean ones to do it. We just had to sleep there because it was late already otherwise we would have left.

The best and most convenient part of the hotel was it's location...Walkable distance from the New Delhi railway station...
Nothing
 · The key access was not working and had to take staff every time to enter my room
" · It was horrible experience. There was no hot water running trough the tap, we visited in February starting so everyone knows the cold in Delhi. ALso the reception staff was too weird and also couldnt give even 1 extra hour after checkout time. Also they dont have kitchen so you have to go outside for food. As it was PlastIndia in Pragati maidan so these hotel people increased their room rates"

best property and good sttaf
"Very confort room and nice bathroom, Near Delhi Airport."
"I never ordered the breakfast, the location was ok, it was a bit inside."
Everything is good and helpful staff
Mostly near to airport
It was close to the airport. For spending the night between two flights it served its purpose.
"Staff is very helpful with everything while on the trip, rooms are just perfect for sleeping."
best hotel
"All staff was good and good food, close to Delhi airport."
"Amazing place near to airport ,new property neat and clean"
The breakfast was good and the staff were friendly.
"Huuge beds. We were with a 2yo child and took a family room to have 2 beds, but we could easily fit in the standard room. Also it was convenient to have a cafe on 5th floor, looked more trustworthy for us to eat there :)"
Very good and supportive staff. Clean room. Comfortable stay. Hygienic toilets.
"The staff are so friendly and helpful. They helped us get a late night meal delivery after we had some difficulty ordering food with a US phone number. It was a quiet hotel in an alley off a busy street. Hot water and comfy bed, nice tv too. Excellent price to value ratio. They even gave a little gift when we left :)"
"Located near to IGI Airport, it is a very good hotel for airport transit passengers. A 3 star hotel with all basic amenities. Food quality was decent, rooms were clean and big. Staffs were well behaved and helpful."
budget friendly
Average hotel with clean room...food was OK.
"Shivaka was a treat - I booked a budget stay & found a clean, comfortable, helpful  & friendly environment / staff. Happy with my choice & will certainly stay again when I pass through next time."
The staff was friendly
Food and  quite place to spend time
About 15 minutes from Delhi IGI Airport terminal 3. All the staffs were very polite and helpful. Room was spacious and clean. Food was good. Highly recommended for night halt near airport.
"Not much to like. Felt like a run down facility. Only 2 guests including me stayed in the full hotel during my stay. Leaky bathroom, not a good airconditioner as it is too old. Had to ask for breakfast as it was included in the room."
"Friendly staff, good location, delicious food"
The staff was very helpful. Nice hotel for stay. chilly panner is a must try 👌🏻
Well maintained Property. Staff behavior is good. Manager Mr. Sharma is very helpful.
"1) Location was on road and easy to find. 
2) Room was spacious and big enough .
3) Staff was courteous enough,  especially the Reception guy was very helpful."

Staff were very cooperative..comfortable food was nice
"Thw location, the help offered by staff food was good room was confortable"
"staff was helpful, especially Sunil."
"It is in a quiet high end residential area with a park opposite to walk around, and opposite to Niti club. when worked the WiFi is extremely strong.restaurants with in a kms distance.good value for money. As many other reviews the manager is extremely helpful."
"The best part of the property is location, it’s so fresh, green and serene. No objection on unmarried couple staying and spending quality time there, I don’t know though maybe loud music and party seen can be a bit of problem though if you’re coming for this purpose since it’s a locality and locals may get offend but then again the management and staff ( Tejendra) he will and can take a good care."
The location was good. Easy to reach.
"location is good, it was not family room with balcony.
on enquiry hotel staff said they don't have any room with balcony.  i booked family room with balcony but it was simple standard double room. & we had to ask for extra bed to accommodate 3 adults."

Great Hotel and fantastic value for your money. The Hotel staff is very friendly and tries everything to make you feel like at home. I will visit again. Thank you!
Perfect location for the airport. We landed late at night and stayed here for just a few hours before a very early morning flight. The hotel arranged a transfer for us both ways which was a fair price and was very easy meaning we didn't have to worry about trying to get a taxi once landing at Delhi airport and then trying to explain where the hotel was. The staff here were helpful and the room was a decent size and clean. The price was cheap and it suited our needs for 1 night.
I like the staff behaviour and breakfast..
Nice accommodation
Need to develop more options for Breakfast
"Great staff , great service, near airport"
Room service was good. They allowed us early check-in. Location of the hotel was also near to the airport.
the location
"The rooms are very big and clean. In room services are slow. Small things like washbasin taps and other taps were running can be improved. Overall, if you are staying for a shorter time then this is the best option near airport."
 · Food
"Very careful people and ready to react to any ask or question. It sense like cute family hotel, where smb always take care about you and they trust you.
Was everything, that I need.
Very grateful"
 · Absence of iron table.. availability of only one iron and that too  old model...
 · There were cockroaches in the room. The window curtains on opening looks over a corridor which is not cleaned up for ages
We were ill for part of our stay and the management and staff looked after us very well. They prepared light meals for us and provided plates of fruit when we didn’t feel like eating
"Simple hotel, but very nice staff, good size room, and I got nearly everything I needed. The location is quite good if you have to do in that part of Delhi."
Clean rooms and well-prepared meals
"Good food.
Good Service."
Nice
location
Only the location
Friendly and Great advise from staff for the rest of trip and best value for money
"the first important thing to say is that Ashu, the owner of the structure, is an incredibly helpful and present person, both by telephone before our arrive and then during the stay (he is not always in the structure, but if needed he arrives in an instant). at the really first contact, he offered us the pickup from the airport but also writing to us very honestly that we could also take a taxi by ourselves, cause is cheaper. I immediately appreciated this sincere approach. And during the days of stay, which were our first days in India and therefore we had various things to organize, he helped us a lot (currency exchange, sim card, etc). Feeling safe at our arrival was priceless. About the room, I can't say that it was very clean, but it was ok: the fan works well, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom decent. My friendly advice to Ashu is to take better care of some aspects (clean surfaces and wardrobes better, fix some mosquito nets, take better care of breakfast) to achieve the high standard he deserves. At that point his hotel will be perfect for the guests. In any case, I can only recommend. Expecially for backpackers as we are it is a good accommodation. Thanks again Ashu."
"family room , spacious room, polite and friendly staff, nice location , terrace for sunshine, nearer to station......."
All was good
location is good. staff is good . cleanliness is good .

"The staff here is very helpful, good service"
VERY GOOD SERVICE 👍
Very good service
Good 👍
It's gud but parking is not available
"The staff was helpful and very kind. We were hungry and they arranged for a fantastic lunch outside hours. They helped us arrange an early taxi the day after our arrival and even called our room to wake us up in case we overslept. 
The fridge was not working, but they repaired it within an hour."
"Staff impecable
Room very clean and bigger than I thought
Beautifully cleaned and decorated room
Bathroom"
"Hotel absolutely did not meet standards of expectations!! Family of crickets found in bed on day 2. We were moved to a 'premium' room which had dodgy electrics, no hot water and no TV. Due to the poor experience we wanted to leave the hotel one night early and find alternative accommodation but we're informed this was against hotel cancellation policy. The hotel manager was extremely rude and implied we were throwing a fuss as we didn't want to play the full bill. Whilst taken a back by the insinuation I explained that we were asking to check out one night early as we were unhappy with the accommodation, we had not asked for a discount!!! Our room was once again 'upgraded' to a room which had very weak WiFi signal which meant the TV did not work as it needed WiFi. The ceiling fan was wobbling all over the place in the room and the bathroom fan was hanging off the ceiling! Not a good stay at all. I would like some form of compensation give that we asked for a room with a TV and hot water. On one night we had no hot water and on two nights no TV. Not very happy with the stay one little bit!!"
"來德里絕對值得推薦，一切非常好

The room is comfortable and the staff is friendly and attentive. The breakfast is very good.
"The room was big enough for a family of four. We booked a deluxe double room. The child of 5 yo slept on a sofa which we put next to the bed. And we had a baby, so he slept together with us."
"1) Courteous and very friendly staff
2) Clean rooms
3) Close proximity to Iskon and lotus temple ( walking distance )  Within 15 mins drive you'd reach Humayun's tomb ( UNESCO World Heritage)  and Sarojini Market."
"My stay was very comfortable. Also Staff was very helpful. Iskcon and lotus temple is near by. Easily transport available. I enjoyed my stay.
 Food was awesome. They have a lot of varieties in menu. All over great experience. Thanks to the hermitage team who make my stay was great."

The staff were professional and went above and beyond to assist us.
The availability of convenient parking was a plus.
The on-site dining options were fantastic.
The hotel's elevators were fast and efficient.
The hotel had a charming and relaxing courtyard area.
The hotel's staff was knowledgeable about local attractions and events.
NULLA!

 · they offered girls to there guest for sex
The staff at this property are all great! They all go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.
They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early. We got to hotel super early and I didn’t wanna wait. So this was a big plus. The service was exceptional as well. Would definitely send a friend there.
"The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable."
I had a good experience. Staff is really very nice and cooperative. They upgraded my room without any additional charges. And I will definitely visit again.
" · Nice location 
Well behaved staff
Comfortable"
We were planning to stay their for 5 days however they asked you to check out in the morning as they have already received the other guest and you can see lots of cockroaches all over and smelly room
"The staff is very cooperative but coming to the room, only few rooms here are good, the bedsheets are not in proper shape, cockroaches around in the room. It’s better if you personally visit the hotel and take up the room."
Nothing to like.
nothing is to like about this hotel. i have booked through booking.com a.c room but when i reach at the hotel they told me it is the non air conditioner room which i booked .as it was night so i have to pay extra for a.c room. they looted customers in the name of facilities. you will find room very small just enough to survive. hotel name is mahalakshmi hotel and they have photo of two hindu ladies at reception but when you reach for online payment name and owner belongs to different community. i do not have problem with this but atleast have a name of your choice why it is so deception in  name .
"Hey,Thankyou so much!
Till now i found the fastest Service  for  amazing service .It was an amazing experience with Hotel and Hotel Staff.He’s an amazing and he also takes care of her clients and he also checked with me if I'm comfortable or not.He has very humble nature❤️"
Hard to get any positives unfortunately of my stay
Nothing
Overall Good I can say
It's clean n comfortable n value for money staff support was good food arrangement was little disturbed but there were eateries just outside near the college campuses
"I stayed there only for 5hours,  because I just  needed a space to take a rest until I take a bus bounce for Varanasi.
Staffs were nice.
Female dorm room was good."
"-close to the Old Delhi train station (my reason to chose this place)
-clean (both rooms and bathrooms)
-curtains
-lockers (but not so spacious)
-24h reception
-soap in the bathroom"
the location
"Stayed there before. Location is great near Kashmir Gate. Dorms are clean and come with curtains, bedlight and locker. Possible to leave lugge before and after check in/out. Staff is friendly"
"Highly appreciate the 24-hour check in / check out scheme. I checked in at 7:00 PM and was able to check out at 7:00 PM too without any additional costs. This is the first hostel that I've encountered this.
Good location - near Kashmere Gate station so it is accessible to 3 metro lines
Good value and better location than any hotels in Paharganj
Lots of food options around the area"
overall OK
"Staff Beviour, 24*7 service"
"Location is great, really close to Kashmiri gate for all travel."
Hostel very well located near bus station and several metro lines. Some hot water. I slept well despite small bed.
"staff didnt allowed to check in even after full payment.
one property is running with three different names"
"Near to Metro,"
 · They denied the booking and didn't co-operate
 · Hotel management ka kahana hai booking app se koi booking nahin Mani jayegi allow nhi kiya unhona bolta cost extra lga ge 2000 bol raha tha

"location was amazing, you have everything around, between  the railway station and metro station, you can go walking! The Staff were very kind and helpful, specially Mr. Tarun Rajput, who helped us a lot with plenty of informations. The hotel also provides exchange money service and booking tickets. The breakfast was very  tasteful but sometimes it was hard to understand waiters."
Over all good
"I would say one of the best, if not the best place in Pahar Ganj and I have seen quite a few. I  was surprised by the cleanliness and think I need to explain: you are in the heart of Delhi and you should love to dive into local life and should not compare apples to oranges. I don't even recall whether the water was cold or hot, but if this is important to you I would recommend one of the artificial luxury islands a bit farer from the action. I also have to admit, that our room was a bit better than the one of our kids, but still ""good enough"". People at the front desk were extremely nice and helpful (I love that giant book where all guest information is registered manually with all that paper based transactions - impressive). We had a room with window and I first feared the noise from the bazar below which actually was no issue at all and I would recommend it. Restaurant was also fine and had places outside with a view on the street below."
I.like staff members
"Lovely building, great restaurant, great location. Bed was firm but good."
"Good location

"They provided me everything I needed, thanks

The manager and staff are very eager to help and I found that all my requests were promptly actioned.
It requires a little renovation but for an older establishment, the room was clean and tidy. I found that I had a good and quiet sleep especially with the air conditioning. It is value for money and considering this factor, I would see myself staying here, if my travel path includes near Dehli airport again."

I have stayed at dozen of hotels in (L). This was on the top of the list of best stays/experiences ever. Staff was very hospitable and there for every need of mine. Thank you so much.
Old hotel not far from the train station. Probably the only reason to stay here. The a.c is not strong enough so it was very hot in the room.
The room for 3 people was good spacious and kind of adjustable.
Spacious room and price
Took Breakfast outside as it start at 8 AM
Good room and services

"Ajay is nothing short of a great human being. As it was our first time in Delhi, he went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and provided us loads recommendations of what to do in the city. Eleven is a great place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city but still a short distance from some famous monuments (i.e. Humayuns Tomb). I would not stay anywhere else next time I'm here. Do yourself a favor and stay here instead of a hotel - you will never get this kind of thoughtfulness and consideration at a hotel stay!"
"A very friendly welcome. A spacious room and wonderful coffee for breakfast as well as the pickled relish ! The household, the garden and the neighbourhood made our first stay a memorable one. Mr. Ajay has been very helpful and kind in every way. We really recommend his B&B !"
"Ajay was an exceptional host. He was very kind and helped me navigate everything India.  I am very grateful that I met him. 
His place is comfortable,  clean and in a location that is quiet away from the bustle of the city centre. 
Highly recommend."
"Super friendly and attentive host who will do everything to make your stay comfortable and worthwhile. 
We will be back here for sure during our next trip to India (Delhi)
Great staff, breakfast and location."
"Ajay was the most wonderful host! He was friendly, had fantastic local recommendations, and we appreciated that he spoke English. The place had a lovely and peaceful garden where you can enjoy the wildlife while eating breakfast. Breakfast was delicious!"
clean & friendly
"Rooms were very clean for Indian standards. 
The environment is silent and safe.
Staff is very nice and helpful. Breakfast prepared to your wishes, also Intercontinental."
"Nice room in a nice neighbourhood and a helpful host, Ajay."
"It was a very good stay, really better than the first we had book in this city. The room was very clean and well arranged. WIFI works perfectly as hot water in the bathroom. All the furnitures were clean. The towels, the sheets, the mattress were new. Bed was confortable. There were full of bottles of water in the room when we arrived. The location is very quiet (it's rare in this city) and easy to find. The owner was very nice and responded quickly. Indian beakfast was good (but a bit more spicy could be great). We stayed only 1 night, but if we want to stay again in Delhi, we won't hesitate to book again in this B&B."
"The place is located within walking distance from Nizamuddin railway station, in a very quiet area. The room is very spacious, clean and quiet, the bed is comfortable. Breakfast is very good. Communication with the host Ajay is easy and quick. Ajay is very kind, welcoming and honest. There was an overbooking problem with our reservation, which was dealt with by Ajay very efficiently and professionally. Ajay offered us one night for free in a neighboring guesthouse of the same standard as his place, and in addition he dropped us off at the train station in the morning. I have no hesitation in recommending this place for a stay in Delhi."
VERY EXCELLENT RECEPTION AND HOSPITALITY.
Ok
Staff behave really good specially a boy name was suraj ....what a guy he is .....talking manners... cleaning....nd all he is fabulous
" · Pl avoid the ground floor room. The staff was talking very loudly the whole day. Even after telling them not to disturb, they were not bothered. Request the management to take care."
 · Room lock was broken and there was a few crawling insects in the room. Food was too much expensive and overpriced.
property location is good for medical needy person.
Place near to all roads served the purpose with security

A very comfortable and peaceful oasis within New Delhi
Great property
"A great place, fully corresponds to the description, ideal for families and individual travelers.
The house is located in a quiet and peaceful place. There are a lot of flowers and greenery on the territory
Delicious breakfast, fresh fruit every morning.
Separately, I would like to express my gratitude to Amrita and the hotel staff, if there are any difficulties, they immediately help"
"This was truly an oasis for us in Delhi.  It is a beautiful, peaceful property with lots of flowers and greenery.  We felt relieved to return here each night after being out on the busy streets of Delhi and Saket during the day.  Amrita, the owner, was wonderful.  She helped us coordinate our activities each day, and her cook prepared delicious dinners for us at night.  I will definitely stay here again if I return to Delhi."
Except for the location this is really creates a home atmosphere . Can stay
"The room was spacious, well-decorated and neat&clean. Our stay was very comfortable. The breakfast and the service were good as well."
We were allowed to leave our luggage there after checkout to pick it up later - very nice people
"Good breakfast
Good location 
Recommended"
"A beautiful farm house style stay. Hospitality was at its best. Big cheers to the energetic Amrita who is a great host. The staff were also very down to earth. 
I enjoyed a lovely home dinner on my first day."
"Our host, Amrita was very helpful and friendly. She helped us with directions and check-in even though it was as late as 1am.
We had a tasty cooked breakfast in the morning and all the staff were very polite and kind. They accommodated our extra requests, such as drying our clothes on the line outside and refilling water bottles.
Amrita also gave us plenty of good suggestions about places to see and restaurants.
It was very easy to pay as well with our cards and we didn't need to fetch cash."
"An outstanding experience at this hotel! No need for further reviews, everything has been said and appreciated. I want to emphasize how attentive and friendly the staff is. All services were top-notch - excellent service, reliable internet, impeccable cleanliness in both the rooms and bathrooms.
The presence of a separate kitchen and lounge on each floor was particularly delightful, providing additional comfort. It allows for pleasant moments and interaction with other guests.
I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the perfect place to stay. You will definitely not regret your choice!"
Very good
"This boutique hotel is extremely clean and detailed oriented. With its minimalistic design, Bungalow is a perfect place to relax after a chaotic day in Delhi. The area is well located."

Excellent airconditioning
Excellent location"
"All the staff members including security guard and the manager name Balram. They are very corporative, helpful and humble. It's nearby to Chandni Chowk, so the location is pretty good."
 · Bathrooms should be repaired and change the fittings atleast once in 3 years of period.
"The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel."
"Very bad experience of stay. Bathroom was leaking, dust on phone not cleaned even after repeated requests, TV monitor  was faulty, atmosphere was noisy, only 1 small thin soap given, no shampoo given,  breakfast of very low and unhygienic quality. 
Only one small palm size thin aloo paratha with pickle was served .No curd or milk was served with aloo paratha. 
Very very poor horrible service. Even rent of RS. 200 per night will be high for this third class hotel. Staff were horrible."
Nothing - just its close by to my venue
"Great location, easy to get in and out of the city. The staff was wonderful. The hotel is well maintained. The beds were very firm, too firm for my liking. The food was good."
The best stay ever. The environment was pleasant and welcoming. Both check-in and check-out were professionally handled and easy.
This is a beautiful hotel! It’s clean and has a lot of comfort items to make you feel at home. We’re in town for a stressful event and coming back to this room was very peaceful.
Friendly staff. Clean hotel. Beautiful atmosphere inside and outside around that part of the city.

This hotel doesnt exists its a big scam. The hotel Flagship Silver stay doesnt exisit I have also compalined to OYO to delist this hotel as it doesnt exisit. When you try to contact the hotel through booking. Com app they wont answer and when they answer they ask for your number.  Then another guy calls up and says I am sending you the location.  P. S when you go to the location there are no hoarding of the hotel or the hotel doesnt exisit. They guy who sent you the location isbof another OYO hotel named comfort stay. They wont accept your booking and charge you double. Booking. Com is a reputed brand and by listing such 3rd class hotels for cheap is damaging the brand value and wont trust booking. Com for listing such inferior and scammed hotels. I didnt sleep for 16 hrs and then it took me 3 hrs to find the hotel ( which doesnt exist and to go to thier other 3rd class hotel) I ended up complaing to OYO and didnt check in.  My humble request to booking. Com if you cant take legal action against such scammers atleast delist them both from your platform.
 · Pathetic condition they ask extra money ...they are fraud
Chutiya banaya tumne ......hotel did not allow us
nothing. actually we were denied to check-in there was price difference of room rent on the app and the price demanded by the property manager.
" · Absolutely no cleanliness. No value for money as i was charged 1162 rupees for a hotel booked in 700 rupees something from your app.  I was charged extra. Moreover, the room were dirty and made us feel unwelcomed as well. You tell us to pay 769 rupees and Oyo charges us 1162 rupees. How is this value for money. The hotel on the second floor with no elevator and least they could have done is to help us with our luggage but no. There is no guard safety and around 2 in the night you can hear people screaming outside your room on the corridor. And washroom with no hand wash , soap and all in all no cleanliness. If you're coming here you are inviting STDs."

Hotel charged extra even after producing confirmation price without any valid reason. They just wanted us to checkout the same day but we booked for night stay.
The rooms were clean and properly maintained.
I will suggest don't go this hotel Oyo is fraud hotel...
"There is no such so called Capital o premium villa.
Infact given address was completely wrong"
The hotel staff at the reception was so rude and he didn't allow us to enter where he ignored our booking and he wanted more money from us.

the price
 · The booking said there would be no Goods and Services Tax applicable whereas they charged the amount anyway camouflaging it as room Tax.
 · The quality of food and the rooms are also small
Reception staff is very courteous
Staff behaviour was gud
Staff response was gud
Good location
" · Allowed room was too small with no table and chairs to sit comfortable.
Each and every time need to sit on the bed .
I see first time in any hotel that there was no sofa chair and table."
 · Rooms were too small and the service is not as per the price charged
"owner cheted the foreigners and i pay from OYO for the booking ,then again owner ask cash and he promised to revers my oyo payment but it naver happened"
"They said that they never let booking.com registered users for the stay.Then I requested to let me two rooms but they said that the price is three times more than the price I booked.Moreover, their behavior was too rude and there was no hotels nearby.So I had to travel so far with old parents and very small babies. Nowonward I can't believe that property listed in booking.com are trustworthy."
" · The place is messed up, room full of mould and stinks and the AC doesn't work"
Food decent enough
It’s very bad service hotel
They charge me 1500 for room actually booking.com and Oyo did fraud with people. They give room offer in 1000 and hotel manager charge 1500 said booking.com pays to Oyo not us you have to give 1500 for booking this is a totally fraud
they denied checkin
They denied and asked for more money
I will never contact this type of Hotel

"We were brought to the Andaz reception by our driver (by mistake) but Ipsi checked us in without delay and looked after us very well, even bringing bananas to the desk for my two hungry children. Christopher helped us to our room and was so kind, courteous, and helpful. He also helped us with all our bags at the end of our stay. Shivauni at the Residences reception helped with our c-forms late at night which was appreciated.
The breakfast staff were wonderfully helpful and welcoming. Gurpreet, Abhendra, Satyam, Jyoti, and another lovely young girl whose name I unfortunately did not write down but she worked in the section near the juice counter and was brilliant in helping us with food choices for our newly adopted indian son. Thank you all."
Nearby airport. Big room.
yes good place to stay with family or friend if you are travelling as a group

 · Not easy to locate in the village.
 · There is no hot water to shower. I stayed in this hotel for three days and geyser is not working. It is in poor condition. How can someone stay in a hotel without shower for three days. I asked to chage the room but not alloted. Atleast asked to provide a bucket of hot water and they haven't. They are too lazy to look at our needs.
VERY BAD

The whole team was all the time caring and made this stay really charming with a touch of familiar atmosphere ."

Location of the hotel is good and in centre of the city
"Location wise Ok for short trip, They need full revamp of the property.  Except for the staffs, property need to match today's standards"
Hotel location
"Food was good, quality as well as quantity. Provided everything we asked for."
Everything except the Water heater was not working properly.
Family runed hotell with a lot of love. Very helpful and friendly staff. Safe and quite area. Great breakfast. Good location.
"beautiful villa very well maintained in a peaceful neighborhood in New Delhi. Staff is very nice and helpful and the restaurants inside are very good, we tried Camillo’s and the pizza was outstanding (we are Italian!). we also had a Spritz at the Inja restaurant bar which was perfect!"
"I have been very pleased of Mr Deepak at the reception desk and his team running the place with such a sens of being welcoming and accommodating. They did their very best to answer to my few requests. We were expecting a renewed hotel as it is mentioned on the website but arrived in a ""work in progress"" hotel. For sure the part already done is really beautifully realised, the materials, the style, everything has been thought. Sadly, no gym, no nice outdoor seatings and the felling to be in the middle of renovation is not the best. I would love to go there again but need to be sure the work is done and not in progress anymore.
By the way, the breakfast area and food are really high level and anyone of the staff is nicely friendly and very helpful."
"I have wanted to stay at The Manor for a long time. Finally I had the opportunity and wasn't disappointed. 
Offering a respite from the crowds, Friends' Colony is a quiet green part of the city but not too far from Connaught Place and Khan Market for example.
The hotel itself is beautiful. I am a modernist at heart so was bound to love the building, that it is spotless and the staff incredibly helpful only add to the quality of a stay here.  I had some issues with my room (just the kind anyone can experience anywhere in the world, low shower pressure for a while and drop in internet) but was given a new room really speedily.
Really recommend The Manor!"
 · Food is super expensive
Loved the zen vibe- a peaceful oasis!
very quiet and peaceful - relaxed
beautifully designed but a tad set apart from the rest of the city but suited my purpose
Good place to stay for weekends stay
"Beautiful architecture, well maintained. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Easy access to excellent Delhi metro, nearby station is ""Ashram""."
"Exilent hotel  good staff food was delicious
Overall good hotel"
for business purpose its not good. as reception area is worst. no kitchen for even tea also. for every requirements you have to ask. some minimum facility must be automatically fullfilled i was expecting.

"This is my second stay in Maya cottage...
Building is really very impressive.
I am happy with the services and quality of the room. 
I'll definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. 
The washroom is cleaned and the bedsheet is neat ..
Only one suggestion to the hotel owner kindly add liquid soap if possible.."
"The staff were very kind & helpful. We were able to check in at 6am (by prior arrangement) which was fantastic.
The location is ideal for NDRS & metro to the airport. Also handy for local markets & numerous food options close by.
This place was ideal for our last day before our late flight."
Location from station; manager was quite cooperative and treat the repeat client with respect.

"Comfortable bed, but a little small for my size even tho I am not tall."
 · The place had a nice infrastructure. It's just that there were 30 beds in a single room which is tooo much and due to which it was very smelly everytime I walked in
 · Staff named Pandey was rude and insensitive. He lied by saying that the beds were all booked but we could see that still there were 5 beds left according to booking.com. He did not even provide breakfast service even after repeated requests and said that the breakfast service can be redeemed only if it was pre-paid. He acts like he owns the place and is absolutely unhelpful to the tenants'/ problems.

The staff at this property are all great! They all go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.
They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early. We got to hotel super early and I didn’t wanna wait. So this was a big plus. The service was exceptional as well. Would definitely send a friend there.

I wish all staff of Good Palace hotel further success and more happy tourists! Thank you."

Staff were wonderful- really helpful & kind. The roof deck is great & we had a great Holi experience there! The location was perfect for exploring Old Delhi. A great choice of food options close by.
"Please keep in mind that European standards are way off in India. The hotel looks completely derelict, the neighborhood is scary (even though I am glad I had the chance to see it with my own eyes) and the TV is not working, the cable has no matching plug. The real positive experience is with the staff, ready to help at any time of the day or night, their sweetness and politeness. Of course the room is spartan, amenities are from a couple of decades back and the building has its best days way behind, but altogether the whole experience has been incredible, including being attacked by a monkey on the rooftop terrace."
Friendly receptionist & Walking distance to the Red fort and bazaar
The property was right in the middle of the market
Frendly welcome.
Good
"Very well located, friendly staff. clean and excellent value. 24 hour room service"
 · wifi signal not coming in my room will use my mobile data all time in room
"Good welcome, goos service and comfortable room"
Don't be fooled by unprepossessing entrance down laneway off Esplanade Road. Hotel is clean and comfortable inside with great views of Red Fort and Jama Masid mosque from roof. Food is very good and room service available 24 hours. Staff very friendly.
Very close to the metro station and Karol Bagh market.
Room was attached with a veranda. Location was good.
No Breakfast as the hotel doesn’t have a restaurant
NA... Did'ent eat felt and looked unhigenice.
Staff was very bad .
The room was great.
The rooms are big and spacious and the staff is very friendly.
"it was perfect i love the way you guys take extra efforts to keep the cleanliness, the entire stay was so peaceful and amazing i was there for a two days rejuvenating energy time as my profession demands me to be at a go."

I liked it beyond my expectations. I would like to tell others to avail as per your need. Also the food quality and quantity were very good.
"Indian food taste is good here.
Spacious room & value for money."
The breakfast and dinner we had was good. The location has proximity to New Delhi railway station. Though the locality is a bit congested the hotel is good. It gives the value for money.

Nothing
The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was spacious and clean. The vintage aesthetics were awesome. Wish we weren’t just passing through!
" · While my room was locked and I was away,
The money I just exchanged was stolen.
just before the number of bills
I counted everything and took notes on paper.
Clearly lost in the room.
Surveillance camera data from the time I was away
I negotiated to have it provided
No reply.
If someone is breaking in, it will always be captured by surveillance cameras.
I strongly feel that it is a crime of the hotel staff who manages the room key.
I will never stay there again."
Had a great stay
"Завтрак, вкусный, есть европейские блюда. Хороший бар с красивым видом на крыше."

Modern hotel. Spacious room. Great breakfast and top notch staff!!!
"The location is very good, very close to the main tourists spots in New Delhi. The room was clean and the wifi was strong."
"Staff are very helpful. Tom was bright and clean. Location is okay, shortish walk to CP"

Able to get hairdryer on demand
The hotel is in a very good location. The check in was very fast. The staff is very helpful.
"The location was excellent for my meetings as it was with Embassies. The property definitely was comfortable and the breakfast was very nice and they had complimentary tea, coffee, soft drinks and snacks which I have not seen at other bloom hotels."
"The location was probably the best part about this hotel. It's relatively close to both the Delhi train station and a lot of the attractions in Delhi (India Gate, Red Fort, etc). Staff was pretty nice."
"Localização excellent and fair price. Good relation cost vs benefit. They have a very convenient common living room in each floor with water,  complimentary snacks and soft drinks."
The polite attitude of the staff and the ease of access and overall experience of the stay.
Everything is good and staff behavior is excellent I really appreciate that

"Room ambience and ac is good ,staff was taking care well"
"Location was good and the bed was comfy with good sheets, but the condition of room was poor, and not maintained and dirty.   The walls had material on them that looked filthy and should be replaced.  Walls and ceilings were dirty.  Windows were dirty.    Positive was bathroom, which was clean and water pressure good."
Location . Safety
"The staff was very helpful and available 24/7 , the location while far from center felt much cleaner than properties closer to the central part of the city. The rooms were clean and comfortable."
Clean bathroom.
Location (close to M block market) and friendliness of staff; also safe for single female traveler
Comfy bed. Room size is sufficient. Staff was very responsive and helpful.
i love their staff most especially i extended my days here until my flight going back to my home country. Love how modern and minimalist this hotel and this is the only hotel that i find good in delhi. thanks to their caring and friendly receptionist and house keeper without them I don’t think i will extended my stay
Conveniently located close to M Block market. Aesthetically build with basic rudimentary interior.
"The location was excellent. The rooms were exactly as shown in the pictures. Cleanliness, amenities, and room service were up to the mark as well. The continental breakfast was also worth the money it cost. Overall, a comfortable stay!"
"Excellent service and very good staff. Very near from Airport.  I enjoy very much. Hotel Manager Ankit was very helpful. In future, definitely, i will stay again in this hotel."
Staff is helpful.
"Small room but cleanliness was good , it was my second stay , nice experience."
 · The manager took rs. 100 extra than described in invoice
"Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the Receptionist and all the total staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. Thank you

"We had come to Delhi for some work and booked in this hotel. After going there, the hotel staff says that we will not give you the room at the booking rate, you will have to pay double the money. We were very upset at night but the staff didn't listen a single thing. Such a bad staff. His behavior was also very bad."
 · They had a price issue and they asked us for paying extra. We paid extra for staying.
" · They charged a lot more than the booking amount.
Fraud people"
Worst property ever
 · charged 150 rs. more than booking amount.

The greatest part of the hotel is the location. It is within 15 minutes of driving distance from all the terminals of New Delhi Airport.
Cleen
Very nice service and good staff
Room . - quiet big.
"5 kilometers from Terminal 3 of the airport.
Very friendly personnel."
"Location , air conditioner"
Dilasious food
Fantastic place to stay...all the staff is very caring and nice....
Very nice hotel and  staff is nice . food is very tasty
 · This was the dirtiest place I've stayed in in India.  No hot water in the bathroom.  I booked 4 rooms for me and 3 friends and was embarrassed by how shabby the accommodations were.  Avoid this property.
Even though the room is super old and kinda mouldy ...lol... They make every effort to make ti clean. I am talking about the floors and bath. There is nothing much.
Location
 · Not a behaviour you expect from the staff. Very disappointed
Staff is good and polite.
"Не могу оставить отзыв, поскольку в отель не заселялись из-за задержки рейса более 5 часов. В отель мы просто не поехали, т.к. следующий рейс был уже через 3 часа."
" · Servizi interni (no ristorante solo delivery del cibo e cena in camera, no spazio per consumarla. Colazione uguale, ma consumabile in giardino, meglio. Struttura vecchia, bagno inadeguato, strumenti di raffreddamento (ventola e AC) molto rumorosa. Si sentono tutti gli aerei che partono e che atterrano, molto difficile prendere sonno."

Location
" · We booked for this hotel on the basis of good reviews however when we checked in, the story was the other way around. 
First, I don't  like when  staff went inside room without our knowledge, after we checked in and we decided to keep our stuffs inside. We knew upon arrival that there was no toiletries and towels(they should get rooms ready before customers will enter) but when we came back after strolling outside, we found out that someone entered and put inside bathroom. If ever that they needed to add fe things, they should ask permission first if it was okay to enter rooms or not.
Second,our package includes meal for  breakfast but on first day of our stay, we saw hair intact in aloo parantha. When we show it to the room delivery guy, he told that it was by mistake that hair was also added in the recipe.
Third, on second day of our stay, next room door was watching movie in full volume like they were in disco. The facility is not sound proof and we can hear them enjoying around 12pm.
 Fourth, on third day of stay,that was early morning, someone tried to open our door aggressively. We requested to check cctv to know who is acting like that which clearly violated our privacy. Reception staff apologised and told that  this will not happen again. Those people occupying next room will go next day.
I attached picture of aloo parantha with hair and the bathroom glass panes which can give someone in balcony a good peek inside bathroom."
"The service, the beds, the bathroom, the glass wall of bathroom was very impressive. The service was exceptional"
Walking distance from the train station. Quiet room despite busy neighbourhood.
The location of the hotel is great. You can get out at the station towards Paharganj side and then it's only 5 mins walk. The room was good. The hotel staffs were very helpful and supportive. Shivaneet welcomed me and helped me through all the stuff.
the property was renovated with excellent shower head and bathroom. the room was stuffy and we didn’t get the room we were allotted. but staff Mohan who was the manager too went above and beyond to accommodate us.
"The rooms were great, clean and comfortable and very quiet, it blocked out the noisy streets."
"Staff,food,homely environment"
Declined to accept the credit in the beginning when they asked me to pay  even before occupying the room. Website say fre airport service but it wasn't.
Excellent !!
Walking distance from the railway station. Very clean.
Everything was more than good
Highly recommended hotel Shanti villa . I liked everything.
"right locatio  if you want to stay in Pagar Ganj but little out of the crazy noise.
clean.
safe place.
stuff is very friendly and helpful."
It is located close to tourists spots.
The location is not very easily reachable. The lane in which the hotel is situated is horrible and doesn't feel safe.
"Good Rooms,Value for Money"
Room was clean and spacious.
"Everything is good.. very Hygiene & Clean room actual its was Shanti Villa no more disturbance n noises.. Totally Silance.. very appreciated to all members ... Staff, owner & cleans ..  I m very impressed only cleaning n .. Silance to visit their."

Descent courtesy.....rooms are neat and clean....we will never forget the courtesy of whole staff ... really we feel a professional touch in their approach...the training they had given to their staff is beyond words.
